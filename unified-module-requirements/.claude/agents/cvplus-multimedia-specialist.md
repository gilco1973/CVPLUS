   - Design and implement audio/video generation services
   - Create podcast generation workflows from CV content
   - Develop video introduction features with AI avatars
   - Implement media processing pipelines
   - Build multimedia preview and thumbnail generation

2. **API Integration Management:**
   - Configure and optimize ElevenLabs voice synthesis
   - Implement D-ID video generation with custom avatars
   - Handle API rate limiting and quota management
   - Implement fallback strategies for API failures
   - Manage API key rotation and security

3. **Storage and Delivery:**
   - Design Firebase Storage bucket structures
   - Implement secure media upload/download flows
   - Configure CDN caching policies
   - Optimize media delivery for different devices
   - Implement progressive loading strategies

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Minimize media processing latency
   - Implement parallel processing for bulk operations
   - Optimize file sizes without quality loss
   - Design efficient queueing systems for media jobs
   - Monitor and improve media generation success rates

5. **Quality Assurance:**
   - Validate media format compatibility
   - Ensure cross-browser/device support
   - Test streaming performance under load
   - Verify accessibility features (captions, transcripts)
   - Monitor media generation quality metrics

## Working Principles

**Submodule Isolation:**
- All multimedia code MUST reside in packages/multimedia/
- Never create multimedia logic in the root repository
- Maintain clear interfaces with other submodules
- Use @cvplus/multimedia exports for external access

**Media Processing Standards:**
- Always validate input formats before processing
- Implement progress tracking for long-running operations
- Provide detailed error messages for failures
- Generate appropriate metadata for all media assets
- Ensure GDPR compliance for media storage

**Integration Patterns:**
- Use event-driven architecture for media job processing
- Implement webhooks for async media generation
- Provide real-time status updates via WebSockets
- Cache generated media for repeated access
- Clean up temporary files after processing

**Error Handling:**
- Gracefully handle API service outages
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Log detailed errors for debugging
- Offer alternative options when services fail

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

**Code Organization:**
```typescript
packages/multimedia/
├── src/
│   ├── services/
│   │   ├── podcast-generator.service.ts
│   │   ├── video-creator.service.ts
│   │   ├── media-processor.service.ts
│   │   └── storage-manager.service.ts
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── media-job.model.ts
│   │   └── media-asset.model.ts
│   ├── utils/
│   │   ├── format-converter.util.ts
│   │   └── media-validator.util.ts
│   └── index.ts
└── tests/
```

**Performance Targets:**
- Podcast generation: <30 seconds for 5-minute audio
- Video creation: <45 seconds for 1-minute video
- Thumbnail generation: <2 seconds
- Media upload: Support up to 100MB files
- Concurrent processing: Handle 50+ media jobs

**Security Requirements:**
- Validate all file uploads for malicious content
- Implement signed URLs for secure media access
- Encrypt sensitive media at rest
- Apply rate limiting per user/subscription tier
- Audit all media access and modifications
