## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ User clearly requests comprehensive recovery of Level 1 modules
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: CVPlus development team, system architects
   ’ Actions: recover, repair, validate, optimize
   ’ Data: Level 1 submodules (@cvplus/core, @cvplus/shell)
   ’ Constraints: error-free, build success, test passing, full quality scores
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [RESOLVED] Architecture verified through CVPlus Layer Architecture documentation
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flow: diagnose issues ’ implement fixes ’ validate success
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement is testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (Level 1 modules and their components)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remaining
   ’ Implementation details excluded (focuses on WHAT, not HOW)
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a **CVPlus development team member**, I need all Level 1 foundation services (@cvplus/core and @cvplus/shell) to be fully operational, error-free, and passing all quality metrics so that the entire CVPlus platform can build successfully and function reliably.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Level 1 module with build errors, **When** the recovery process is executed, **Then** all build errors are resolved and the module compiles successfully
2. **Given** a Level 1 module with failing tests, **When** the recovery process is applied, **Then** all tests pass with 100% success rate
3. **Given** a Level 1 module with architectural violations, **When** the recovery process is implemented, **Then** the module complies with CVPlus Layer Architecture standards
4. **Given** both Level 1 modules are recovered, **When** the entire CVPlus platform builds, **Then** no Level 1 dependency errors occur
5. **Given** recovered Level 1 modules, **When** quality audits are performed, **Then** all modules achieve full scores across all quality metrics

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Level 1 modules have circular dependencies that violate layer architecture?
- How does the system handle Level 1 modules that depend on Layer 2 modules (architectural violations)?
- What occurs when build processes timeout due to complex dependency resolution?
- How does the recovery process handle modules with corrupted TypeScript configurations?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST identify and catalog all build errors in Level 1 modules (@cvplus/core, @cvplus/shell)
- **FR-002**: System MUST resolve TypeScript compilation errors including missing module declarations and export mismatches
- **FR-003**: System MUST fix all architectural violations where Level 1 modules incorrectly import from Layer 2 modules
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure all Level 1 module tests pass with 100% success rate
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate compliance with CVPlus Layer Architecture specifications
- **FR-006**: System MUST achieve error-free builds for both @cvplus/core and @cvplus/shell modules
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain Layer 1 dependency restrictions (only Layer 0 and external dependencies allowed)
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure Level 1 modules can be built independently in correct dependency order
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate that recovered modules support all downstream Layer 2 module builds
- **FR-010**: System MUST achieve full quality scores across all defined metrics (code coverage, lint compliance, type safety)

### Key Entities

- **Level 1 Foundation Services**: The two core modules that form CVPlus foundation layer
  - **@cvplus/core**: Shared types, utilities, and configuration module with identified TypeScript errors
  - **@cvplus/shell**: Main orchestrator application with successful build status
- **Build Errors**: Compilation failures preventing successful module builds
  - TypeScript module resolution errors (Cannot find module '@cvplus/cv-processing')
  - Missing export declarations (Module has no exported member 'UserOutcome')
  - Architectural violations (Layer 1 importing from Layer 2)
- **Quality Metrics**: Measurable standards that define "full score" achievement
  - Build success rate (target: 100%)
  - Test pass rate (target: 100%)
  - Code coverage percentage (target: minimum threshold)
  - Architectural compliance (target: zero violations)
  - TypeScript compilation success (target: zero errors)

## Current State Analysis

### Level 1 Module Health Status

**@cvplus/core (Foundation Service)**
-  Directory exists and properly structured
- L **BUILD FAILED** - Multiple TypeScript compilation errors
- L **TESTS STATUS** - Cannot run due to build failures
- = **Primary Issues**:
  - Cannot find module '@cvplus/cv-processing' (architectural violation)
  - Cannot find module '@cvplus/recommendations' (architectural violation)
  - Missing exports from '@cvplus/analytics' (UserOutcome, OutcomeEvent, MLPipeline, etc.)

**@cvplus/shell (Main Orchestrator Application)**
-  Directory exists and properly structured
-  **BUILD SUCCESS** - Compiles without errors
-  **TESTS STATUS** - Ready for validation
-  Vite build produces optimized output (487.47 kB bundle)

### Architectural Compliance Status
Based on CVPlus Layer Architecture documentation:
- **Layer 1 Definition**: Foundation Services (@cvplus/core, @cvplus/shell)
- **Allowed Dependencies**: Layer 0 (@cvplus/logging) and external npm packages only
- **Violations Found**: @cvplus/core attempting to import from Layer 2 modules

### Recovery Priority Classification
1. **CRITICAL**: @cvplus/core build failures blocking entire ecosystem
2. **HIGH**: Architectural violations in dependency imports
3. **MEDIUM**: Test validation and quality metric achievement
4. **LOW**: Performance optimization and documentation updates

---

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success Metrics
- **Build Success Rate**: 100% for both Level 1 modules
- **Test Pass Rate**: 100% for all Level 1 module test suites
- **Architectural Compliance**: Zero violations of CVPlus Layer Architecture
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Zero compilation errors across all Level 1 modules
- **Dependency Resolution**: Clean dependency tree following layer restrictions

### Business Impact Metrics
- **Platform Stability**: CVPlus platform builds successfully from foundation up
- **Development Velocity**: Unblocked development workflow for all teams
- **Code Quality**: Maintained high standards across foundational services
- **Architectural Integrity**: Enforced layer boundaries for long-term maintainability

This specification provides the foundation for a comprehensive Level 1 recovery plan that will restore the CVPlus platform to full operational health while maintaining architectural integrity and quality standards.
