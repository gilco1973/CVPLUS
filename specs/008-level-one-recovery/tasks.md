# Tasks: Level One Recovery - Complete Health, Integrity, and Implementation Recovery

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/008-level-one-recovery/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✅), research.md (✅), spec.md (✅)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Tech stack: TypeScript 5.3+, Node.js 20+, Vitest, Git submodules
   → Structure: Web application (complex multi-package monorepo)
2. Load research.md ✅
   → Decisions: Layer architecture enforcement, systematic error resolution
   → Critical issues: @cvplus/core build failures, architectural violations
3. Generate recovery tasks by category:
   → Diagnostic: Error cataloging, dependency analysis
   → Repair: Fix build errors, architectural violations
   → Validation: Test execution, quality metrics
   → Quality: Performance optimization, compliance verification
4. Apply recovery rules:
   → Build fixes before test execution
   → Core module before shell validation
   → Different modules = mark [P] for parallel
   → Layer violations must be sequential
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Validate recovery completeness:
   → All build errors identified and fixed?
   → All architectural violations resolved?
   → All tests pass with 100% success rate?
7. Return: SUCCESS (recovery ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different modules, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths for all recovery operations

## Path Conventions
**CVPlus Submodule Structure**:
- **Level 1 Core**: `/Users/gklainert/Documents/cvplus/packages/core/`
- **Level 1 Shell**: `/Users/gklainert/Documents/cvplus/packages/shell/`
- **Analytics**: `/Users/gklainert/Documents/cvplus/packages/analytics/`
- **Other Layer 2**: `/Users/gklainert/Documents/cvplus/packages/{module}/`

## Phase 3.1: Diagnostic & Setup
- [ ] T001 Create recovery feature branch `008-level-one-recovery`
- [ ] T002 [P] Catalog all TypeScript compilation errors in `/Users/gklainert/Documents/cvplus/packages/core/`
- [ ] T003 [P] Analyze dependency violations in Level 1 modules using architectural compliance scan
- [ ] T004 [P] Document current test status for both Level 1 modules
- [ ] T005 Verify git submodule status and integrity for all Level 1 dependencies

## Phase 3.2: Critical Build Error Resolution ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These errors MUST be fixed before any testing or validation**

## Phase 3.5: Architectural Compliance Validation
- [ ] T023 Validate Layer 1 modules only import from Layer 0 (@cvplus/logging) and external packages
- [ ] T024 Verify no circular dependencies exist between Level 1 modules
- [ ] T025 [P] Test that all Layer 2 modules can still build successfully after Level 1 fixes
- [ ] T026 [P] Validate dependency resolution order: Layer 0 → Layer 1 → Layer 2
- [ ] T027 Document architectural compliance status and any remaining violations

## Dependencies
**Critical Path**:
- Build error fixes (T006-T012) before compilation validation (T013-T016)
- Compilation success before test execution (T017-T022)
- Test success before architectural validation (T023-T027)
- Foundation stability before performance optimization (T028-T032)

**Specific Blockers**:
- T006 blocks T013 (core build must succeed)
- T008 blocks T025 (analytics exports needed for Layer 2)
- T013-T014 block T017-T018 (build before tests)
- T021 blocks T038 (individual tests before platform build)

## Parallel Execution Examples
```bash
# Phase 3.1 Diagnostics (can run simultaneously):
Task: "Catalog TypeScript errors in core module"
Task: "Analyze dependency violations in Level 1 modules"
Task: "Document current test status for both modules"

# Phase 3.4 Test Validation (after builds succeed):
Task: "Fix test failures in core module test suite"
Task: "Fix test failures in shell module test suite"
Task: "Run test coverage analysis and document percentages"

# Phase 3.7 Quality Compliance (independent files):
Task: "Refactor oversized services in analytics module"
Task: "Run ESLint validation on all Level 1 modules"
Task: "Verify modules follow CVPlus coding standards"
```

## Success Criteria Validation
Each phase must achieve specific success metrics:

**Phase 3.2**: Zero TypeScript compilation errors in Level 1 modules
**Phase 3.3**: 100% build success rate for @cvplus/core and @cvplus/shell
**Phase 3.4**: 100% test pass rate for all Level 1 module test suites
**Phase 3.5**: Zero architectural violations, clean dependency tree
**Phase 3.8**: Entire CVPlus platform builds successfully from foundation up

## Notes
- **[P] tasks** = different modules/files, no shared dependencies
- **Sequential tasks** = same file modifications or dependent operations
- Commit after each completed phase for rollback safety
- Validate before proceeding to next phase
- Maintain backward compatibility throughout recovery process

## Emergency Procedures
- **If critical errors emerge**: Stop current phase, return to diagnostic mode
- **If platform build fails**: Isolate to specific Layer 2 module, fix incrementally
- **If tests fail**: Do not proceed to next phase until 100% pass rate achieved
- **Rollback trigger**: Any breaking changes to public APIs or external contracts
