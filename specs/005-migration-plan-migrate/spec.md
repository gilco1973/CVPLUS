# Feature Specification: CVPlus Code Migration to Submodules

**Feature Branch**: `005-migration-plan-migrate`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "migration plan: migrate all existing code in in parent cvplus project except for necessary code that must remain in the parent project, all other code needs to be migrated to the submodules."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Migration plan to move code from parent project to submodules
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Development team, System architects
   ’ Actions: Code migration, submodule organization, architecture cleanup
   ’ Data: Source code files, configuration, tests, documentation
   ’ Constraints: Preserve necessary orchestration code in root
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Migration criteria clearly defined based on architectural analysis
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Post-migration validation scenarios defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement testable through build/deployment verification
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Code modules, submodules, configuration files identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No implementation details included, focused on business value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a development team, we need to complete the migration of all business logic code from the parent CVPlus repository to appropriate git submodules to achieve full architectural compliance, maintainability, and modularity while preserving only necessary orchestration functions in the root repository.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current CVPlus codebase with mixed code organization, **When** migration is completed, **Then** all business logic code must be located in appropriate submodules with only orchestration functions remaining in root
2. **Given** existing functionality and external API contracts, **When** code is migrated to submodules, **Then** all existing functionality must continue to work without breaking changes
3. **Given** development workflow requirements, **When** submodule architecture is implemented, **Then** developers must be able to work independently on each domain with clear boundaries
4. **Given** deployment and CI/CD requirements, **When** migration is complete, **Then** the build and deployment process must work seamlessly with the new submodule structure

### Edge Cases
- What happens when functions have cross-domain dependencies?
- How does the system handle version conflicts between submodules?
- What occurs during development when a submodule is temporarily unavailable?
- How are shared utilities and constants handled across submodules?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST migrate all business domain code from root repository to appropriate git submodules under /packages/ directory
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve only legitimate orchestration functions in the root repository (calendar, meeting, email scheduling functions)
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain all existing external API endpoints and contracts without breaking changes
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure each submodule operates as an independent git repository with its own version control
- **FR-005**: System MUST organize migrated code according to domain boundaries (CV processing, multimedia, analytics, etc.)
- **FR-006**: System MUST update all import/export chains to reference @cvplus/* package imports from submodules
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve all existing functionality including Firebase Functions, frontend components, and utilities
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain proper TypeScript compilation and type checking across all submodules
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure all tests continue to pass after migration with proper test organization in submodules
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate that no business logic code remains in the root functions/ directory after migration
- **FR-011**: System MUST establish clear module boundaries to prevent circular dependencies between submodules
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain build and deployment processes compatible with the new submodule architecture

### Key Entities

- **Root Repository**: Container for orchestration functions and submodule references, maintaining only cross-domain coordination code
- **Submodule Packages**: Independent git repositories under /packages/ containing domain-specific business logic, components, and services
- **Migration Mapping**: Classification system determining which code belongs in which submodule based on functional domain
- **API Contracts**: External interface specifications that must be preserved during migration to ensure no breaking changes
- **Import Dependencies**: Reference chains between modules that must be updated to use @cvplus/* package imports
- **Test Suites**: Validation code that must be migrated alongside business logic to appropriate submodules
- **Configuration Files**: Environment and build configuration that may need updates for submodule structure
