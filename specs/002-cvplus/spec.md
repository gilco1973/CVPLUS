## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a job seeker, I want to upload my traditional CV and receive an enhanced, interactive version with multimedia elements that helps me stand out to recruiters and passes ATS systems, so that I can increase my chances of landing interviews and job opportunities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a PDF CV file, **When** they upload it to the platform, **Then** the system analyzes the content and generates an enhanced CV with AI-powered improvements and multimedia options
2. **Given** a user has selected enhancement features, **When** they confirm their choices, **Then** the system generates the selected multimedia content (podcast, video, timeline) and makes them available for download or sharing
3. **Given** a user has generated an enhanced CV, **When** they choose to create a public profile, **Then** the system generates a shareable link with privacy controls and contact options
4. **Given** a recruiter accesses a public profile, **When** they view the enhanced CV, **Then** they can interact with multimedia elements and contact the candidate through built-in forms

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an uploaded CV is in an unsupported format?
- How does system handle corrupted or malicious files?
- What occurs when AI analysis cannot extract meaningful content?
- How does the platform manage concurrent enhancement requests?
- What happens when external AI services are unavailable?
