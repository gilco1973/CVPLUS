# Feature Specification: Comprehensive Logging System for CVPlus

**Feature Branch**: `003-a-comprehensive-logging`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "a comprehensive logging system. the system needs to be applied also to the cvplus /packages. the implementation of cvplus is described in /Users/gklainert/Documents/cvplus/specs/002-cvplus , consider matching the loggiing to the various parts of cvplus"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Comprehensive logging system for CVPlus platform and all packages identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: developers, administrators, security analysts, operations teams
   ’ Actions: log events, monitor performance, debug issues, track usage, audit security
   ’ Data: application logs, security events, performance metrics, error traces
   ’ Constraints: privacy compliance, performance impact, storage costs, retention policies
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Marked specific log retention and compliance requirements
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flow: Event logging to centralized analysis and alerting
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Structured logging, centralized collection, real-time monitoring, compliance
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Log entries, log streams, alerts, audit trails
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ All sections completed with marked clarifications
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a platform operator, I want comprehensive logging across all CVPlus components so that I can monitor system health, debug issues quickly, ensure security compliance, and track usage patterns to improve the service and meet regulatory requirements.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a CV processing request is initiated, **When** the system processes the request, **Then** all processing steps, performance metrics, and outcomes are logged with correlation IDs for traceability
2. **Given** a security event occurs (failed authentication, suspicious activity), **When** the event is detected, **Then** it is immediately logged with appropriate security classification and stakeholders are alerted
3. **Given** a system error occurs in any package, **When** the error is encountered, **Then** the error details, stack trace, and context are logged with severity level for debugging
4. **Given** an administrator needs to audit user activity, **When** they query the logging system, **Then** they can retrieve comprehensive audit trails with user actions, timestamps, and outcomes
5. **Given** performance issues are suspected, **When** operators analyze system logs, **Then** they can identify bottlenecks through performance metrics and timing data across all components

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the logging system itself fails or becomes unavailable?
- How does the system handle log data when storage limits are reached?
- What occurs when sensitive information is accidentally included in log messages?
- How does the system manage logging during high-traffic periods without impacting performance?
- What happens when regulatory requirements change for log retention periods?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST log all user authentication events with outcome, timestamp, IP address, and user agent
- **FR-002**: System MUST log all CV processing events including start time, processing duration, features used, and completion status
- **FR-003**: System MUST log all file upload and download events with file metadata, user context, and security validation results
- **FR-004**: System MUST log all API requests and responses with response times, status codes, and payload sizes
- **FR-005**: System MUST log all database operations including query performance, connection pool status, and transaction outcomes
- **FR-006**: System MUST log all external service integrations (AI APIs, multimedia services) with request/response details and costs
- **FR-007**: System MUST log all security events including failed authentication, privilege escalation attempts, and suspicious patterns
- **FR-008**: System MUST log all subscription and billing events including payment processing, subscription changes, and credit usage
- **FR-009**: System MUST log all public profile interactions including views, contact form submissions, and content sharing
- **FR-010**: System MUST log all administrative actions including user management, system configuration changes, and data exports
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide structured logging with consistent format across all CVPlus packages (core, auth, cv-processing, multimedia, analytics, premium, recommendations, public-profiles, admin, workflow, payments, i18n)
- **FR-012**: System MUST assign correlation IDs to track requests across multiple services and packages
- **FR-013**: System MUST classify log entries by severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL)
- **FR-014**: System MUST categorize log entries by domain (security, performance, business, system, audit)
- **FR-015**: System MUST implement real-time log streaming for critical events and alerts

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Log Entry**: Individual log record containing timestamp, severity, message, context data, and correlation information
- **Log Stream**: Categorized sequence of log entries from specific sources (packages, services, or domains)
- **Alert Rule**: Configuration defining conditions that trigger notifications for critical events
- **Audit Trail**: Chronological record of user and system actions for compliance and security analysis
- **Log Archive**: Historical log data stored for long-term retention and compliance requirements
- **Performance Metric**: Aggregated measurements derived from log data for monitoring system health and performance
