# Tasks: Comprehensive Logging System for CVPlus

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-a-comprehensive-logging/`
**Prerequisites**: spec.md (required), plan.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: TypeScript/Node.js stack, Winston backend, Firebase integration
   → Structure: Web application (frontend + backend + packages)
2. Load optional design documents:
   → spec.md: Extract 25 functional requirements → logging tasks
   → entities: LogEntry, LogStream, AlertRule, AuditTrail, LogArchive, PerformanceMetric
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: core logging library, dependencies, configuration
   → Tests: integration tests for each logging domain
   → Core: logging models, services, correlation tracking
   → Integration: package integrations, Firebase transport
   → Polish: performance optimization, monitoring dashboard
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different packages = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same files = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Validated task completeness:
   → All 12 CVPlus packages covered
   → All 25 functional requirements addressed
   → TDD ordering enforced
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Monorepo structure**: `packages/*/src/`, `frontend/src/`, `functions/src/`
- **Core logging library** (Layer 0): `packages/logging/src/backend/`
- **Package integrations** (Layer 1+): `packages/*/src/logging/`

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within same phase

- Commit after each task completion
- Layer-based package integration follows CVPlus build dependencies
- Performance target: <2% application performance impact
- Security requirement: Automatic PII redaction for compliance
