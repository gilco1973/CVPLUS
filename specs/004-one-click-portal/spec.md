## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature identified: One Click Portal for premium users
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Job applicants, Recruiters/hiring managers
   ’ Actions: Generate portal, exhibit work, AI chat about CV
   ’ Data: CV content, portal configuration, chat history
   ’ Constraints: Premium feature, RAG-based AI responses
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All requirements clearly defined from existing implementation analysis
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flow: Premium user generates portal with one click
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement is testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (CV data, portal config, chat sessions, RAG embeddings)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
   ’ Implementation details avoided, focused on business requirements
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A premium CVPlus user (job applicant) wants to create a professional web portal with a single click that showcases their CV, work portfolio, and enables recruiters to interact with an AI assistant that can answer questions about their background and qualifications. The recruiter can visit this portal, browse the applicant's information, and engage in natural language conversations with an AI that has deep knowledge of the candidate's CV content through RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) technology.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a premium user has uploaded their CV and selected portfolio items, **When** they click "Create One Click Portal", **Then** a fully functional web portal is generated and deployed with a unique URL within 60 seconds
2. **Given** a portal is successfully created, **When** a recruiter visits the portal URL, **Then** they see a professional presentation of the applicant's CV information, portfolio items, and a prominent AI chat interface
3. **Given** a recruiter is viewing a portal, **When** they type a question about the applicant's experience into the AI chat, **Then** the AI provides accurate, contextual responses based on the CV content with source citations
4. **Given** a recruiter asks "What programming languages does this candidate know?", **When** the AI processes the query, **Then** it retrieves relevant sections from the CV and provides a comprehensive answer with confidence scoring
5. **Given** a premium user wants to update their portal, **When** they modify their CV or portfolio content, **Then** the portal automatically reflects these changes within 5 minutes
6. **Given** a user wants to track portal engagement, **When** they access their portal analytics, **Then** they see visitor counts, popular sections, chat interactions, and session durations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the portal generation fails due to insufficient CV content?
- How does the system handle recruiters asking questions not covered in the CV?
- What occurs when multiple recruiters chat simultaneously on the same portal?
- How does the system respond to inappropriate or off-topic questions from recruiters?
- What happens when a user's premium subscription expires with an active portal?
