# Tasks: Frontend Unified Module with Microservices Architecture

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/012-frontend-unified-module/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (available), research.md (available), data-model.md (available)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Frontend microservices architecture with 10 domain-specific microservices
   → Tech stack: TypeScript 5.8+, React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Firebase SDK
   → Structure: Unified module with internal microservice separation
2. Load design documents:
   → research.md: Microservices patterns, domain mapping, technical implementation
   → data-model.md: State management, data boundaries, cross-microservice communication
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Microservice infrastructure, shared tooling, configuration
   → Core Microservices: Create each domain microservice with proper structure
   → Migration: Move domain-specific code to appropriate microservices
   → Integration: Cross-microservice communication, shared state management
   → Polish: Testing, documentation, performance optimization
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different microservices = parallel [P] when independent
   → Same microservice structure = sequential for consistency
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. SUCCESS: 65+ numbered, ordered tasks for microservices implementation
```

```

```bash
# Launch T063-T071 together - Creating microservice exports
Task(subagent_type="typescript-pro", description="Create auth-ui exports", prompt="Create comprehensive barrel exports in packages/frontend/src/microservices/auth-ui/index.ts exporting all components, hooks, contexts, and types")

Task(subagent_type="typescript-pro", description="Create premium-ui exports", prompt="Create comprehensive barrel exports in packages/frontend/src/microservices/premium-ui/index.ts exporting all premium feature components and subscription management")
```

## Microservice-Specific Implementation Guidelines

### Microservice Boundaries
- **auth-ui**: Authentication flows, session management, permission gates, user profile UI
- **cv-processing-ui**: CV upload, analysis, generation, preview, ATS optimization UI
- **multimedia-ui**: Video generation, audio processing, media library, podcast creation UI
- **analytics-ui**: Charts, dashboards, reporting, metrics visualization, business intelligence
- **premium-ui**: Subscription management, billing, feature gates, upgrade flows
- **public-profiles-ui**: Profile sharing, social features, testimonials, portfolio display
- **admin-ui**: System administration, user management, monitoring dashboards, security tools
- **workflow-ui**: Job management, workflow automation, task tracking, certification badges
- **payments-ui**: Payment processing, transaction history, billing management, invoicing
- **core-ui**: Layout, navigation, theming, shared components, common utilities

### Cross-Microservice Communication Rules
1. **No Direct Imports**: Microservices communicate through events and shared contracts
2. **Shared State**: Only authentication and theme state shared across microservices
3. **Type Safety**: Shared types defined in packages/frontend/src/shared/types/
4. **Error Isolation**: Each microservice has error boundaries preventing cascade failures

### Import Pattern Standards
```typescript
// ✅ Correct - Microservice internal imports
import { ComponentName } from '../components/ComponentName';
import { useHook } from '../hooks/useHook';

// ✅ Correct - Cross-microservice imports
import { AuthGuard } from '@cvplus/frontend/auth-ui';
import { CVPreview } from '@cvplus/frontend/cv-processing-ui';

// ❌ Incorrect - Direct cross-microservice internal imports
import { ComponentName } from '../../../auth-ui/components/ComponentName';
```

## Success Criteria
1. **Domain Separation**: Clear boundaries between business domains with no cross-contamination
2. **Independent Development**: Each microservice can be developed and tested independently
3. **Performance Optimization**: Selective loading of microservices with optimized bundles
4. **Maintainability**: Clear ownership and focused testing per microservice
5. **Scalability**: Easy addition of new microservices following established patterns

## Risk Mitigation
- **Complexity Management**: Clear documentation and consistent patterns across microservices
- **Bundle Size Control**: Aggressive tree-shaking and shared core infrastructure
- **Development Experience**: IDE integration, automated validation, and clear error messages
- **Performance Monitoring**: Bundle analysis and lazy loading validation per microservice

## File Count Summary
- **Total Files to Organize**: 985+ files from root frontend and package frontends
- **Microservices Created**: 10 domain-specific microservices
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Core-UI microservice + application shell
- **Result**: Domain-separated architecture within unified module

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different microservices/domains, no dependencies
- Sequential tasks modify shared infrastructure or have cross-microservice dependencies
- Verify microservice boundaries after each phase
- Commit after completing each microservice setup
- Test cross-microservice communication after integration phase
