# Feature Specification: Frontend Unified Module

**Feature Branch**: `012-frontend-unified-module`
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "frontend unified module: create a frontend  module to be the single source for all frontend web app for the project. migrate all frontend code from all other modules including the root to that frontend module"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Create unified frontend module as single source of truth for all web application code
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: developers, build system, deployment pipeline
   ’ Actions: create module, migrate code, consolidate architecture
   ’ Data: React components, TypeScript types, configuration files, assets
   ’ Constraints: maintain functionality, preserve module boundaries, ensure proper imports
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Build system integration approach specified
   ’ Module structure follows CVPlus architectural patterns
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Development workflow remains seamless
   ’ All frontend functionality preserved after migration
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ All requirements are testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Frontend module, component libraries, configuration files, build artifacts
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No implementation details specified in requirements
   ’ All business requirements clearly defined
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the CVPlus project, I need all frontend web application code consolidated into a single unified module so that I can have a clear single source of truth for frontend development, easier dependency management, and simplified build processes while maintaining the modular architecture.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** frontend code exists across multiple modules and the root directory, **When** the unified frontend module is created, **Then** all React components, TypeScript types, and web application assets are consolidated into a single packages/frontend module
2. **Given** a developer needs to find frontend code, **When** they look for components or types, **Then** they can find everything in the packages/frontend module rather than searching across multiple locations
3. **Given** the build system processes frontend code, **When** it builds the application, **Then** it sources all frontend code from the unified module with proper import resolution
4. **Given** other modules need frontend components, **When** they import frontend code, **Then** they import from @cvplus/frontend rather than local paths or scattered locations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when modules have conflicting frontend dependencies or component names?
- How does the system handle circular dependencies during migration?
- What happens to existing import paths in the codebase after migration?
- How are module-specific frontend configurations preserved while consolidating?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST create a unified packages/frontend module that serves as the single source for all web application code
- **FR-002**: System MUST migrate all React components (.tsx/.jsx files) from all existing modules to the unified frontend module
- **FR-003**: System MUST migrate all TypeScript type definitions related to frontend from all modules to the unified frontend module
- **FR-004**: System MUST migrate all frontend configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts, etc.) from root frontend directory to the unified module
- **FR-005**: System MUST migrate all static assets (HTML, CSS, images) from the root frontend directory to the unified module
- **FR-006**: System MUST update all import statements across the codebase to reference @cvplus/frontend for frontend components and types
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve all existing frontend functionality during and after migration
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain proper module boundaries where backend modules do not contain frontend code
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure the unified frontend module follows CVPlus architectural patterns for git submodules
- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve all environment configurations and build scripts in the unified module
- **FR-011**: System MUST update the root-level build system to reference the unified frontend module
- **FR-012**: System MUST remove all frontend code from non-frontend modules after successful migration
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain all existing npm dependencies related to frontend development in the unified module

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Frontend Module**: The new unified packages/frontend module containing all web application code, components, types, and configurations
- **Source Locations**: Current frontend code scattered across root/frontend directory and various packages with .tsx/.jsx files
- **Component Library**: All React components currently distributed across multiple modules that need consolidation
- **Type Definitions**: TypeScript interfaces and types related to frontend functionality across modules
- **Configuration Files**: Build, environment, and development configuration files for frontend tooling
- **Import References**: All import statements across the codebase that reference frontend code and need updating
