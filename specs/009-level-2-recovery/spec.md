# Feature Specification: Level 2 Submodules Complete Recovery

**Feature Branch**: `009-level-2-recovery`
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "level 2 recovery: read the cvplus overall architecture doc and create a plan for full helth , integrity, and implementation recovery of all level 2 submodules. all level 2 module must be error free, build correctly, have their tests pass and achieve a full score in all aspects"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Level 2 recovery requires comprehensive health restoration of all domain service modules
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: CVPlus Platform Maintainers, Development Teams
   ’ Actions: Build repair, Test restoration, Dependency resolution, Code quality enhancement
   ’ Data: 11 Level 2 submodules with varying degrees of failure
   ’ Constraints: Must achieve 100% build success, 100% test pass rate, full architectural compliance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Architecture compliance criteria clearly defined in layer architecture documentation
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear workflow for systematic module recovery and validation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement is testable with specific success criteria
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ 11 Level 2 Domain Service Modules requiring recovery
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ All requirements are measurable and testable
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a CVPlus Platform Maintainer, I need all 11 Level 2 domain service modules to be fully operational, error-free, and compliant with the layered architecture so that the platform can be developed, deployed, and maintained reliably without build failures, test failures, or architectural violations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** any Level 2 module is selected, **When** the build command is executed, **Then** the build must complete successfully with zero errors and zero warnings
2. **Given** any Level 2 module is selected, **When** the test suite is executed, **Then** all tests must pass with 100% success rate and adequate coverage
3. **Given** the entire Level 2 layer, **When** dependency validation is performed, **Then** all modules must comply with the layered architecture rules with no cross-module dependencies
4. **Given** any Level 2 module, **When** code quality analysis is performed, **Then** the module must achieve full compliance scores across all quality metrics
5. **Given** the recovery process is complete, **When** the complete CVPlus platform is built and tested, **Then** all systems must function correctly with no regressions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a module has deep dependency conflicts that require architectural changes?
- How does the system handle modules with missing essential dependencies or corrupted configuration?
- What validation ensures recovered modules maintain backward compatibility with existing integrations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Build System Recovery
- **FR-001**: System MUST restore build capability for all 11 Level 2 modules (auth, i18n, cv-processing, multimedia, analytics, premium, public-profiles, recommendations, admin, workflow, payments)
- **FR-002**: System MUST resolve all TypeScript compilation errors across all modules
- **FR-003**: System MUST fix all dependency resolution issues and import/export conflicts
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure each module builds with zero errors and zero warnings
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate build artifacts are properly generated for each module

#### Test System Recovery
- **FR-006**: System MUST restore test execution capability for all Level 2 modules
- **FR-007**: System MUST fix all failing tests to achieve 100% test pass rate
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure adequate test coverage for all critical functionality
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate test suites run independently without cross-module interference
- **FR-010**: System MUST implement missing test scripts where absent (currently workflow module)

#### Architectural Compliance Recovery
- **FR-011**: System MUST enforce Layer 2 dependency rules - modules can only depend on Layer 0 (logging) and Layer 1 (core, shell)
- **FR-012**: System MUST eliminate all peer dependencies between Layer 2 modules
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate proper import chains using @cvplus/core and @cvplus/logging paths
- **FR-014**: System MUST ensure all modules are properly configured as git submodules
- **FR-015**: System MUST validate build order compliance with layer hierarchy

#### Code Quality Recovery
- **FR-016**: System MUST fix all linting errors and enforce consistent code style
- **FR-017**: System MUST resolve all type safety issues and ensure proper TypeScript configuration
- **FR-018**: System MUST eliminate unused dependencies and optimize package configurations
- **FR-019**: System MUST ensure all modules follow consistent structure and conventions
- **FR-020**: System MUST validate documentation completeness for each module

#### Integration Recovery
- **FR-021**: System MUST restore Firebase Functions integration for backend modules
- **FR-022**: System MUST validate proper export chains from all modules to root functions/src/index.ts
- **FR-023**: System MUST ensure frontend components integrate properly with backend services
- **FR-024**: System MUST validate cross-module communication through proper interfaces
- **FR-025**: System MUST restore deployment capability for all modules

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

#### Level 2 Domain Service Modules
- **Auth Module**: Authentication and session management - currently builds  but tests fail 
- **I18n Module**: Internationalization framework - currently builds  but tests fail 
- **CV-Processing Module**: CV analysis and enhancement - currently build fails , tests unknown
- **Multimedia Module**: Media generation and processing - currently build fails , tests unknown
- **Analytics Module**: Business intelligence and tracking - currently builds , tests unknown
- **Premium Module**: Subscription and billing features - currently build fails , tests unknown
- **Public-Profiles Module**: Public profile functionality - currently build fails , tests unknown
- **Recommendations Module**: AI-powered recommendations - currently build fails , tests unknown
- **Admin Module**: Admin dashboard and management - currently build fails , tests unknown
- **Workflow Module**: Job management and workflows - currently build fails , no test script 

#### Recovery Status Categories
- **Healthy Modules**: 2 modules (auth, i18n, analytics) - partial functionality, builds work
- **Critical Recovery Modules**: 8 modules (cv-processing, multimedia, premium, public-profiles, recommendations, admin, workflow, payments) - build failures require immediate attention
- **Testing Recovery**: All 11 modules require test suite restoration and validation
