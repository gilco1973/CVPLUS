# Implementation Plan: Unified Module Requirements

**Branch**: `007-unified-module-requirements` | **Date**: 2025-09-13 | **Spec**: [spec.md](/Users/gklainert/Documents/cvplus/specs/007-unified-module-requirements/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/007-unified-module-requirements/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Standardize all CVPlus submodules with consistent structural requirements, documentation, configuration, and validation. This enables developers to quickly understand and maintain any module while ensuring reliable CI/CD processes. The primary requirement is establishing unified standards for README files, package.json scripts, directory structure, TypeScript configuration, entry points, testing setup, naming conventions, and dependency management across all 18+ submodules in the CVPlus ecosystem.

## Critical Architectural Requirements

**🚨 MANDATORY MODULE STANDARDS** - Each module MUST comply with ALL of the following:

1. **Code Segregation Principle**: Each module should NOT have ANY code not required by it. If such code exists, it MUST be immediately migrated to the relevant modules where it belongs.

2. **Distribution Architecture**: Each module MUST be closed to direct code usage and reference and open to distribution. Every module MUST have a `dist/` folder with properly built and packaged code for consumption.

3. **Real Implementation Only**: NO stubs, placeholders, commented out code, or mock implementations are allowed. ONLY real, functional implementations are permitted.

4. **Build and Test Standards**: All modules MUST have a clean build without errors and warnings, and their tests MUST pass completely.

5. **Dependency Chain Integrity**: Each module MUST maintain the correct dependency chain without circular dependencies or architectural violations.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+, Node.js 18+
**Primary Dependencies**: Varies by module (Firebase Functions, React, Express, etc.)
**Storage**: Configuration files, module templates, compliance schemas
**Testing**: Jest/Vitest for modules, validation scripts for compliance
**Target Platform**: All CVPlus submodules (cross-platform)
**Project Type**: Multi-module ecosystem (18+ git submodules)
**Performance Goals**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: validation frequency - on commit, daily, or on-demand?]
**Constraints**: Self-contained modules, backward compatibility, minimal disruption
**Scale/Scope**: 18+ existing submodules, standardization across entire CVPlus codebase

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 3 (validation-cli, template-generator, compliance-dashboard)
- Using framework directly? YES (Node.js fs, path modules directly)
- Single data model? YES (ModuleStructure, ComplianceRule, ValidationReport)
- Avoiding patterns? YES (direct file operations, no unnecessary abstractions)

**Critical Architectural Compliance**:
- Code segregation validation? YES (detect misplaced code, suggest migrations)
- Distribution architecture enforcement? YES (validate dist/ folder existence and contents)
- Mock/stub detection? YES (scan for placeholders, commented code, incomplete implementations)
- Build/test validation? YES (verify clean builds and passing tests)
- Dependency chain analysis? YES (detect circular dependencies and violations)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? YES (validation-lib, template-lib, reporting-lib)
- Libraries listed:
  - validation-lib: Module structure validation and compliance checking
  - template-lib: Standardized module template generation
  - reporting-lib: Compliance report generation and visualization
- CLI per library:
  - validate-module --path [module] --format [json|text]
  - generate-template --type [module-type] --output [path]
  - generate-report --modules [paths] --format [html|json]
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned? YES

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? YES (tests written first)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? YES (enforced)
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? YES
- Real dependencies used? YES (actual module files, no mocks)
- Integration tests for: module validation, template generation, compliance reporting
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? YES (validation results, compliance scores)
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A (CLI tools with structured output)
- Error context sufficient? YES (specific compliance violations with remediation)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 1.0.0
- BUILD increments on every change? YES
- Breaking changes handled? YES (backward compatibility for existing modules)

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project with library-based CLI tools for module validation and standardization)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- API contract → validation CLI contract test [P]
- API contract → template generation CLI contract test [P]
- API contract → reporting CLI contract test [P]
- Each entity (ModuleStructure, ComplianceRule, ValidationReport, ModuleTemplate) → model creation task [P]
- Each quickstart scenario → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make contract/integration tests pass
- CLI implementation tasks for validation, template generation, and reporting
- **Critical Architectural Validation Tasks**:
  - Code segregation scanner → detect misplaced code across modules [P]
  - Distribution architecture validator → verify dist/ folder compliance [P]
  - Mock/stub detector → scan for non-implementation code [P]
  - Build validation engine → verify clean builds across all modules [P]
  - Dependency chain analyzer → detect circular dependencies and violations [P]

**Ordering Strategy (TDD-first)**:
1. **Contract Tests Phase** (Red phase):
   - API contract tests for validation endpoints
   - API contract tests for template generation endpoints
   - API contract tests for compliance reporting endpoints
   - All tests must fail initially (no implementation)

2. **Model Creation Phase** [P]:
   - ModuleStructure type definitions and validation
   - ComplianceRule schema and validation logic
   - ValidationReport aggregation and scoring
   - ModuleTemplate structure and customization

3. **Integration Test Phase**:
   - Quickstart scenario 1: Module validation workflow
   - Quickstart scenario 2: Template generation workflow
   - Quickstart scenario 3: Batch validation workflow
   - Quickstart scenario 4: Auto-remediation workflow
   - Quickstart scenario 5: Ecosystem monitoring workflow
   - Quickstart scenario 6: Legacy module migration workflow

4. **CLI Implementation Phase**:
   - validation-lib core logic (make contract tests pass)
   - template-lib core logic (make contract tests pass)
   - reporting-lib core logic (make contract tests pass)
   - CLI command interfaces and argument parsing
   - Error handling and user feedback

5. **Validation and Polish Phase**:
   - Performance optimization (< 30 sec validation)
   - Documentation generation (llms.txt format)
   - Integration with CVPlus ecosystem
   - Backward compatibility validation

**Parallel Execution Markers [P]**:
- Model creation tasks (independent type definitions)
- Library implementations (separate domains)
- Contract test creation (independent endpoints)
- Documentation tasks (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 32-38 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Libraries and CLI Commands to Implement**:
1. **validation-lib** + CLI: `cvplus-validator validate|validate-all|fix|ecosystem|trends|segregation|distribution|mocks|builds|dependencies`
2. **template-lib** + CLI: `cvplus-generator list-templates|create`
3. **reporting-lib** + CLI: `cvplus-reporter generate|monitor|trends`
4. **migration-lib** + CLI: `cvplus-migrator analyze|plan|migrate`
5. **architecture-lib** + CLI: `cvplus-architect scan-segregation|check-distribution|detect-mocks|validate-builds|analyze-dependencies`

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
