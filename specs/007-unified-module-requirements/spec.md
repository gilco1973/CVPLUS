# Feature Specification: Unified Module Requirements

**Feature Branch**: `007-unified-module-requirements`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "unified module requirements. each submodul should be structured, have required files and comply to defined self contained module requirements"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature focuses on standardizing CVPlus submodule structure
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: developers, CI/CD systems, module maintainers
   ’ Actions: create, maintain, validate module compliance
   ’ Data: module files, configurations, dependencies
   ’ Constraints: self-contained, standardized structure
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific compliance validation frequency]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: enforcement mechanism for non-compliant modules]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flows for developers creating/maintaining modules
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ All requirements are testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (module structure, compliance rules)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Spec focuses on business value of standardized modules
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on CVPlus, I need all submodules to follow consistent structural requirements so that I can quickly understand, maintain, and integrate any module without learning module-specific conventions. This standardization enables faster development, reduces onboarding time, and ensures reliable CI/CD processes across all modules.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new developer joins the CVPlus team, **When** they examine any submodule, **Then** they should find a predictable structure with documentation, configuration, and entry points in expected locations
2. **Given** a CI/CD pipeline processes any submodule, **When** it runs standard operations (build, test, lint), **Then** it should execute successfully using uniform commands across all modules
3. **Given** a module maintainer needs to update dependencies, **When** they follow the unified requirements, **Then** they should have clear guidance on version management and compatibility
4. **Given** an automated tool scans submodules for compliance, **When** it validates module structure, **Then** it should identify non-compliant modules and provide specific remediation steps

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a legacy module doesn't meet current requirements?
- How does the system handle modules with specialized needs that conflict with standard requirements?
- What occurs when unified requirements change and existing modules need migration?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Each submodule MUST contain a standardized README.md file with consistent sections (Purpose, Installation, Usage, API, Contributing, License)
- **FR-002**: Each submodule MUST include a package.json with standardized scripts for common operations (build, test, lint, dev)
- **FR-003**: Each submodule MUST maintain a consistent directory structure with src/, tests/, docs/, and dist/ directories where applicable
- **FR-004**: Each submodule MUST include TypeScript configuration files (tsconfig.json) with unified compiler settings
- **FR-005**: Each submodule MUST provide clear entry points and export definitions in a standardized index file
- **FR-006**: Each submodule MUST include automated testing setup with minimum coverage requirements
- **FR-007**: Each submodule MUST follow consistent naming conventions for files, functions, and exports
- **FR-008**: Each submodule MUST include dependency management with version pinning and security scanning
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate module compliance through automated checks [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: validation frequency - on commit, daily, or on-demand?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide standardized templates for creating new compliant modules
- **FR-011**: System MUST generate compliance reports showing module adherence to requirements
- **FR-012**: Non-compliant modules MUST be flagged with specific remediation guidance [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: enforcement mechanism - warnings, build failures, or blocking merges?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Module Structure**: Represents the standardized directory layout, file organization, and configuration requirements that each submodule must follow
- **Compliance Rule**: Defines specific requirements that modules must meet, including file presence, naming conventions, and configuration standards
- **Validation Report**: Contains assessment results for module compliance, including pass/fail status and remediation recommendations
- **Module Template**: Standardized starting point for new modules that ensures compliance from creation
