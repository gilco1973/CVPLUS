# Feature Specification: End-to-End Testing Flows Submodule

**Feature Branch**: `006-end-to-end`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "end to end flows: create a new submodule: end to end flows, the new module will be responsible for various scenarios of end to end flows for testing the cvplus flow and for testing specific modules full flows, it should contain mock data for testing and should provide flows also for testing the backend only using curl"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’  Feature description provided: E2E testing submodule for CVPlus
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Testers, CI/CD systems, developers
   ’ Actions: Execute flows, validate responses, generate test data
   ’ Data: Mock CVs, user profiles, test scenarios
   ’ Constraints: Must test both full flows and backend-only flows
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Performance thresholds for test execution]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Test data retention policy]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Integration with existing test suites]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’  Clear user flows: developers running E2E tests, CI validation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’  Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’  Test scenarios, mock data, flow results identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’   WARN "Spec has uncertainties - marked with NEEDS CLARIFICATION"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer or QA engineer, I need a comprehensive end-to-end testing framework that validates the entire CVPlus user journey from CV upload through multimedia generation, ensuring all integrations work correctly and providing both automated validation and manual testing capabilities with realistic test data.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh CVPlus environment, **When** I execute a complete user flow test, **Then** the system validates CV upload, analysis, multimedia generation, and public profile creation with realistic mock data
2. **Given** a specific submodule (e.g., cv-processing), **When** I run its isolated flow test, **Then** the system validates all module-specific functionality without requiring full system deployment
3. **Given** backend APIs are deployed, **When** I execute curl-based test flows, **Then** the system validates all API endpoints with proper authentication, data validation, and response formatting
4. **Given** a CI/CD pipeline execution, **When** automated E2E tests run, **Then** the system provides clear pass/fail results with detailed logs and performance metrics
5. **Given** a regression testing scenario, **When** I run comparative flow tests, **Then** the system detects changes in behavior and performance against baseline expectations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when mock data generation fails or produces invalid test scenarios?
- How does the system handle partial flow failures where some steps succeed but others fail?
- What occurs when testing flows against different environment configurations (dev, staging, production)?
- How are concurrent test executions managed to prevent data conflicts?
- What happens when external service dependencies (OpenAI, ElevenLabs) are unavailable during testing?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
