### 2. **Intelligent Retry Logic**
When verification fails:
- Generates improved prompts based on specific issues identified
- Includes detailed feedback from verification failures
- Implements exponential backoff for retry attempts
- Maximum retry limits to prevent infinite loops

### 3. **Security-First Design**
- **PII Detection**: Automatic identification and sanitization of sensitive data
- **Injection Prevention**: Detection of potential prompt injection attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable request throttling per service/IP
- **IP Blocking**: Automatic blocking for suspicious activity patterns
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event tracking

### 4. **Performance Optimization**
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking verification operations
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Adjustable quality standards per environment
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when verification systems fail
- **Resource Management**: Memory-efficient event storage and cleanup

### 5. **Compliance & Audit**
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every verification attempt logged
- **PII Sanitization**: Automatic removal of sensitive data from logs
- **Compliance Reporting**: Built-in metrics for SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR
- **Incident Response**: Automated response to security events

## Integration Guide

### 1. Quick Integration (Minimal Changes)

For services that want verification with minimal code changes:

```typescript
import { cvParsingWrapper } from '../services/llm-integration-wrapper.service';

// Replace existing Claude calls
const result = await cvParsingWrapper.parseCV(cvText, userInstructions);

// Access verification results
console.log('Verified:', result.verified);
console.log('Score:', result.verificationScore);
```

### 2. Advanced Integration

For new services or those needing full control:

```typescript
import { VerifiedClaudeService } from '../services/verified-claude.service';

const claudeService = new VerifiedClaudeService({
  verificationEnabled: true,
  validationCriteria: VerifiedClaudeService.createValidationCriteria('custom-service')
});

const response = await claudeService.createVerifiedMessage({
  service: 'my-service',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
  validationCriteria: customCriteria
});
```

### 3. Custom Service Wrapper

Create service-specific wrappers:

```typescript
import { LLMIntegrationWrapperService } from '../services/llm-integration-wrapper.service';

export class MyServiceLLMWrapper extends LLMIntegrationWrapperService {
  constructor() {
    super({
      serviceName: 'my-service',
      customValidationCriteria: {
        accuracy: true,
        completeness: true,
        customCriteria: [
          {
            name: 'my_specific_validation',
            description: 'Service-specific validation rule',
            weight: 0.9
          }
        ]
      }
    });
  }

  async myServiceMethod(data: any): Promise<any> {
    return await this.callClaude({
      prompt: this.buildPrompt(data),
      context: { serviceData: data }
    });
  }
}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Required for all functionality
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key

# Required for verification (can be disabled)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Optional - defaults provided
NODE_ENV=development|staging|production
```

### Configuration Customization

```typescript
import { llmVerificationConfig } from '../config/llm-verification.config';

// Environment-specific settings
const config = {
  ...llmVerificationConfig,
  verification: {
    ...llmVerificationConfig.verification,
    confidenceThreshold: 0.8, // Stricter validation
    maxRetries: 2 // Fewer retries for faster response
  }
};
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. **Rate Limiting**

- **With Verification**: ~4-8 seconds (additional OpenAI call)
- **With Retry**: +2-4 seconds per retry attempt

### Cost Impact
- **Additional Cost**: ~$0.01-0.03 per verification (OpenAI GPT-4)
- **Cost Savings**: Reduced manual review and error correction
- **ROI**: Improved response quality and reduced support tickets

### Success Rates (Expected)

- **Retry Success Rate**: 70-80% (after feedback)
- **Overall Quality Improvement**: 20-30% measured by manual evaluation

## Error Handling & Fallbacks

### 1. **Verification Service Failures**
```typescript
// Automatic fallback when OpenAI is unavailable
{
  verified: false,
  fallbackReason: 'verification_service_unavailable',
  recommendation: 'manual_review_recommended'
}
```

### 2. **Claude API Failures**
```typescript
// Structured error responses with security logging
{
  error: 'claude_api_timeout',
  fallbackAvailable: true,
  securityEventLogged: true
}
```

### 3. **Configuration Errors**
```typescript
// Built-in configuration validation
const validation = validateLLMConfig(config);
if (!validation.valid) {
  throw new Error(`Configuration invalid: ${validation.errors.join(', ')}`);
}
