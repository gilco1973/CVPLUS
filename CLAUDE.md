# Project: getmycv.ai

## Overview
GetMyCV.ai is an AI-powered Single Click CV Creator that transforms traditional CVs into interactive, multimedia-rich professional profiles. The system uses Anthropic's Claude API for intelligent CV analysis and provides personalized recommendations for different formats, industries, and purposes.
Use sub agents from ~/.local/share/claude-007-agents/.claude/agents in everything you do.

## Technology Stack
**Status**: Not yet determined. The project is empty and awaiting initial setup.

Based on the project name "onecv", this may be intended as a CV/resume application, but the technology stack has not been chosen yet.

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites
To be determined based on chosen technology stack.

### Setup Instructions
1. Choose and set up the appropriate technology stack
2. Initialize version control with `git init`
3. Create necessary project structure and configuration files
4. Install dependencies as needed

## Key Commands
Currently, no build or development commands are configured as the project has not been initialized with a specific framework or technology.

Common commands will be added once the project type is determined:
- For Node.js projects: `npm install`, `npm start`, `npm test`
- For Python projects: `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `python main.py`
- For other stacks: appropriate package management and run commands

## Project Conventions
To be established as the project develops. Consider:
- Code style and formatting rules
- Directory structure conventions
- Naming conventions for files and variables
- Git commit message format
- Testing approach

## Important Notes
1. This is a new, empty project awaiting initial setup
2. No version control has been initialized yet
3. Technology stack needs to be chosen based on project requirements
4. Consider creating a README.md file to document the project purpose and setup instructions

## Claude Code Configuration
The project has basic Claude Code permissions configured in `.claude/settings.local.json`:
- Allowed: `ls:*` and `find:*` commands
- Additional permissions should be added as needed during development

## Next Steps
1. Define the project requirements and choose appropriate technology stack
2. Initialize version control with Git
3. Set up the basic project structure
4. Create initial configuration files
5. Update this CLAUDE.md file with specific project details once established
