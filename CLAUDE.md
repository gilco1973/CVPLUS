You are an AI software engineer operating with strict execution standards. Apply the following rules **universally and consistently** across all coding tasks:

1. üö´ **Never create mock data or use placeholders.**
   - Do not fabricate data.
   - Always request real input data sources or clearly flag missing data as a blocking issue.

2. üö® **CRITICAL PROHIBITION: NEVER DELETE FILES WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER APPROVAL - EVER!**
   - **ZERO TOLERANCE**: Do not delete, remove, or destroy ANY files without explicit user consent.
   - **MANDATORY**: Always ask for manual user approval before deleting ANY file or directory.
   - **NO EXCEPTIONS**: This applies to temporary files, backups, source code, configs, docs, scripts, and ALL file types.
   - **ENFORCEMENT**: Unauthorized file deletion is considered a critical failure and security violation.
   - **PROCESS**: Identify ‚Üí Ask User ‚Üí Get Explicit Approval ‚Üí Then Delete (never skip approval step)
   - **SAFETY**: When in doubt, DO NOT DELETE - ask the user first.

3. üß† **Always use subagents for all tasks.**
   - Every task (including planning, execution, testing, debugging, etc.) must be handled by an appropriate subagent.
   - Subagents must have clearly defined scopes and responsibilities.

4. üìã **Always generate a TodoList before you begin.**
   - Include all high-level and granular subtasks necessary for successful task completion.
   - Revisit and update the list as needed during execution.

5. üìä **Use model OpusPlan (Opus 4.1) for planning and task breakdown.**
   - Invoke OpusPlan to:
     - Generate project plans.
     - Break complex requests into subproblems.
     - Define workflows and dependencies.

   **Use model Sonnet 4.1 for execution.**
   - Execute the individual tasks and subplans using the Sonnet model.
   - Apply Sonnet for code generation, implementation, and testing.

6. ‚úÖ **Every code solution must include a complete and executable test suite.**
   - Test suites must be:
     - Comprehensive (cover edge cases, expected flow, and error handling).
     - Written in the same language as the codebase (e.g., Python ‚Üí `pytest`, TypeScript ‚Üí `jest` or `vitest`).
     - Self-contained and reproducible.

7. üîÅ **If any test fails, fix iteratively with a dedicated subagent.**
   - Launch a "TestFixer" subagent with a sole purpose:
     - To analyze, fix, and validate failing tests.
   - This subagent must run iteratively until all tests pass.

8. üîÅ **If there are TypeScript or Python errors (e.g., type-checking, compile-time errors), resolve them iteratively.**
   - Use a dedicated "LintFixer" or "TypeFixer" subagent.
   - Iteratively fix and revalidate until the codebase is error-free and all type checks pass.

9. üîÅ **When creating a document, always place in in an appropriate subfolder under /docs**
   - Before creating a new document, scan the codebase and make sure there are no loose documents not under /docs and that the document you are about to create does not exist already.
   - Every Planning document MUST be accompanied by one or more mermaid diagrams that will be placed under /docs/diagrams/.
 
10. üîÅ **When creating a batch script, always place  in an appropriate subfolder under /scripts**
       - Before creating a new batch script, scan the codebase and make sure there are no loose scripts not under /scripts  and that the script you are about to create does npt exist already.

11. üèóÔ∏è **MANDATORY: All code MUST be located in git submodules under /packages - NEVER in root repository**
   - **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: All source code, components, services, and modules MUST be created within their respective git submodules under `/packages/` directory
   - **ZERO TOLERANCE**: Do NOT create ANY code files in the root CVPlus git repository
   - **Module Structure**: Each package is an independent git submodule with its own repository:
     - `packages/core/` - Core types, constants, utilities (git@github.com:gilco1973/cvplus-core.git)
     - `packages/auth/` - Authentication and session management (git@github.com:gilco1973/cvplus-auth.git)
     - `packages/i18n/` - Internationalization framework (git@github.com:gilco1973/cvplus-i18n.git)
     - `packages/multimedia/` - Media processing and storage (git@github.com:gilco1973/cvplus-multimedia.git)
     - `packages/premium/` - Subscription and billing features (git@github.com:gilco1973/cvplus-premium.git)
     - `packages/public-profiles/` - Public profile functionality (git@github.com:gilco1973/cvplus-public-profiles.git)
     - `packages/recommendations/` - AI-powered recommendations engine (git@github.com:gilco1973/cvplus-recommendations.git)
     - `packages/admin/` - Admin dashboard and management (git@github.com:gilco1973/cvplus-admin.git)
     - `packages/analytics/` - Analytics and tracking services (git@github.com:gilco1973/cvplus-analytics.git)
   - **ENFORCEMENT**: Creating code in the root repository is considered a critical architectural violation
   - **PROCESS**: Always identify the appropriate package/module ‚Üí Navigate to packages/[module]/ ‚Üí Create/edit code there
   - **Git Operations**: Each submodule has independent git history and must be committed separately to its own repository

12. üéØ **MANDATORY: Submodule tasks MUST be orchestrated by specialized submodule subagents**
   - **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: When executing ANY task related to a specific submodule, the task MUST be orchestrated by the corresponding specialized submodule subagent
   - **ZERO TOLERANCE**: Do NOT handle submodule-specific tasks directly - always delegate to the appropriate specialist
   - **Submodule-Specialist Mapping**:
     - `packages/core/` tasks ‚Üí **core-module-specialist** subagent
     - `packages/auth/` tasks ‚Üí **auth-module-specialist** subagent  
     - `packages/i18n/` tasks ‚Üí **i18n-specialist** subagent
     - `packages/multimedia/` tasks ‚Üí **multimedia-specialist** subagent
     - `packages/premium/` tasks ‚Üí **premium-specialist** subagent
     - `packages/public-profiles/` tasks ‚Üí **public-profiles-specialist** subagent
     - `packages/recommendations/` tasks ‚Üí **recommendations-specialist** subagent
     - `packages/admin/` tasks ‚Üí **admin-specialist** subagent
     - `packages/analytics/` tasks ‚Üí **analytics-specialist** subagent
   - **ENFORCEMENT**: Direct handling of submodule tasks without specialist orchestration is considered a critical architectural violation
   - **PROCESS**: Identify target submodule ‚Üí Use Task tool with appropriate specialist subagent ‚Üí Let specialist orchestrate the task
   - **Specialist Responsibilities**: Deep understanding of module architecture, dependencies, testing strategies, and domain-specific requirements

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not shortcut these instructions**. Always adhere to this full lifecycle:
1. Plan with OpusPlan.
2. Generate a TodoList.
3. Assign tasks to subagents.
4. Execute with Sonnet.
5. Test thoroughly.
6. Fix iteratively.

# Project: CVPlus

## Overview
CVPlus is an AI-powered CV transformation platform that takes traditional CVs "From Paper to Powerful", reinventing them into interactive, multimedia-rich professional profiles. The system uses Anthropic's Claude API for intelligent CV analysis and provides personalized recommendations with cutting-edge interactive features.
Use sub agents from ~/.local/share/claude-007-agents/.claude/agents in everything you do.

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
üö® **CRITICAL: Never delete ANY files without explicit user approval - this is a security violation**
