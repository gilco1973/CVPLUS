💡 RECOMMENDATIONS:
===================
🔴 HIGH PRIORITY: Address 17 critical violations
   - Missing dist/ folders need immediate attention
   - Remove any mock/stub code from production modules
   - Ensure all modules have proper package.json and build scripts
🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY: Address 13 warning violations
   - Add missing test scripts and TypeScript configurations
   - Move test files to proper test directories
   - Clean up TODO/FIXME comments
