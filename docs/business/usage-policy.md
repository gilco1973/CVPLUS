# CVPlus Usage Policy

## Overview

We believe in making powerful CV improvement tools accessible to everyone. To keep our service sustainable and fair, we've outlined the following policies for Free and Premium users.

## Free Plan

### What's included:
- Up to 3 CV uploads per month
- Light parsing with basic AI suggestions (clarity, grammar, structure)
- Basic formatting only
- Always free

### Limitations:
- No advanced features like ATS optimization, premium templates, or cover letters
- No document history saved
- Exports are limited (plain text or watermarked) to prevent misuse
- Intended for personal use only

## Lifetime Premium Plan

Our Lifetime Plan is designed for serious job seekers who want full access to all premium tools.

### What's included:
- Unlimited refinements on your own CV

### Fair Use Policy:
- **Unlimited refinements** for your own CV
- **3 unique CVs per month** = different identities or majorly different versions
- **Accounts are strictly for personal use** (not for friends or clients)
- **Exported files** (PDF/HTML) are licensed for personal, individual use only. Editing them to represent another person or sharing them as a service is prohibited
- **Professional use** (coaches, recruiters, agencies) requires a Professional Plan

## Professional Use

If you are a career coach, recruiter, or agency, please contact us about a Professional Plan. This ensures fair usage and provides higher-volume tools designed for professional needs.

## Enforcement

We monitor usage to keep things fair. Accounts may be suspended or terminated for:

- Uploading CVs that don't belong to the account owner
- Exceeding fair-use limits in ways that impact system availability
- Sharing or reselling account access
- Editing or distributing exported files (PDF/HTML) for anyone other than the account holder

## Fair Use (Simple Explanation)

- **Unlimited edits** on your own CV
- **3 unique CVs per month** = up to 3 different versions/identities
- **Exports are for personal use only**. Sharing or modifying them for others is against policy
- **Limit is to prevent account sharing**. You can perfect your own CV endlessly

### Tooltip Version (one-liners):
- "Unlimited edits on your CV. The 3/month cap just stops account sharing."
- "3 unique CVs = 3 different versions. Unlimited refinements included."
- "Polish your CV endlessly â€” the limit is only for fairness."
