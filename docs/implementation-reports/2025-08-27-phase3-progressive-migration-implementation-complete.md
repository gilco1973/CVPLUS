    duration: string;
  }[];
  
  monitoringThresholds: {
    errorRateThreshold: number;    // 5%
    latencyThreshold: number;      // 2x baseline
    throughputThreshold: number;   // 90% minimum
    customMetrics: Record<string, number>;
  };
}
```

### Rollback Automation System
```typescript
interface RollbackResult {
  success: boolean;
  rollbackId: string;
  serviceId: string;
  scope: 'SERVICE' | 'PHASE' | 'COMPLETE';
  reason: string;
  duration: number;
  actions: string[];
