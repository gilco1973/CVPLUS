   - Email verification enforcement in production intact

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Rate limiting middleware for authenticated functions preserved
   - User-specific request throttling maintained
   - Security logging and monitoring intact

## Architecture Improvements ✅

### Modular Organization

- **Centralized Authentication**: All auth logic consolidated in `packages/auth/`
- **Clean Import Paths**: `@cvplus/auth` for all authentication imports
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and types
- **Service Architecture**: Layered services for auth, tokens, sessions, premium

### Enhanced Developer Experience

- **Migration Utilities**: Smooth transition from root repository components
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy wrappers for existing components
- **Comprehensive Hooks**: Specialized hooks for auth, permissions, premium, Google OAuth
- **Migration Scripts**: Automated import path updates

## Migration Impact

### Before Migration
- Authentication scattered across multiple root files
- 1,680+ lines of duplicated auth logic
- Tight coupling between auth and other modules
- Inconsistent import paths

### After Migration 
- All authentication centralized in `packages/auth/`
- Modular architecture with clean separation
- Consistent `@cvplus/auth` import paths
- Enhanced developer experience with specialized hooks

## Deployment Considerations

### Required Actions

1. **Package Installation**
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd frontend && npm install
   # Functions
   cd functions && npm install
   ```

2. **Build Authentication Module**
   ```bash
   cd packages/auth && npm run build
   ```

3. **Run Migration Script**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/auth/migrate-auth-imports.sh
   ```

4. **Test Authentication Flows**
   - Sign-in with email/password
   - Google OAuth integration
   - Premium feature access
   - Admin authentication

### Environment Variables

All existing Firebase configuration and Google OAuth settings remain unchanged.

## Success Metrics ✅

### Functionality Preservation
- ✅ All authentication flows work identically
- ✅ Premium status detection and caching functional
- ✅ Google OAuth and calendar integration working
- ✅ Admin authentication and RBAC preserved

### Architecture Improvement
- ✅ All auth components properly modularized
- ✅ Clean import paths using `@cvplus/auth`
- ✅ Reduced coupling between auth and other modules
- ✅ Improved type safety and consistency
