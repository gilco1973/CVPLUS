# CVPlus Security Remediation Action Plan
**Date:** August 23, 2025  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Immediate Implementation Required  
**Estimated Timeline:** 12 weeks  
**Investment Required:** $50,000 - $75,000

## Phase 1: Critical Security Fixes (Week 1-2) üö®

### 1.1 Security Headers Implementation
**Priority:** CRITICAL | **CVSS:** 8.2 | **Effort:** Low

**Current State:** Security headers configuration exists but not deployed  
**Target State:** Production security headers actively enforced

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Firebase Hosting Security Headers** (Day 1-2)
```json
// firebase.json - Add security headers
{
  "hosting": {
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Content-Security-Policy",
            "value": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'strict-dynamic' https://js.stripe.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; img-src 'self' data: blob: https:; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; connect-src 'self' https://*.firebaseapp.com https://*.googleapis.com; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; upgrade-insecure-requests"
          },
          {
            "key": "Strict-Transport-Security", 
            "value": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
          },
          {
            "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
            "value": "nosniff"
          },
          {
            "key": "X-Frame-Options", 
            "value": "DENY"
          },
          {
            "key": "X-XSS-Protection",
            "value": "1; mode=block"
          },
          {
            "key": "Referrer-Policy",
            "value": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
          },
          {
            "key": "Permissions-Policy",
            "value": "camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=()"
          }
        ]
      }

**Target State:** Comprehensive rate limiting across all endpoints

#### Rate Limiting Configuration:
```typescript
// Rate limiting configurations
export const RATE_LIMITS = {
  CV_PROCESSING: { windowMs: 300000, maxRequests: 1 }, // 1 per 5 minutes
  FILE_UPLOAD: { windowMs: 300000, maxRequests: 5 },   // 5 per 5 minutes  
  AI_REQUESTS: { windowMs: 60000, maxRequests: 10 },   // 10 per minute
  GENERAL_API: { windowMs: 60000, maxRequests: 100 },  // 100 per minute
  AUTHENTICATION: { windowMs: 60000, maxRequests: 5 }  // 5 per minute
};
```
