**Strengths:**
- Google OAuth-only authentication strategy eliminates password-related vulnerabilities
- Comprehensive token validation with expiry checking
- Email verification enforcement in production environments
- Proper authentication state monitoring and error handling
- Session management with automatic token refresh capabilities

**Findings:**
```typescript
// Strong authentication validation in authGuard.ts
export const requireAuth = async (request: CallableRequest): Promise<AuthenticatedRequest> => {
  if (!request.auth) {
    throw new HttpsError('unauthenticated', 'User must be authenticated');
  }
  
  // Proper token expiry validation
  if (token.exp <= currentTime) {
    throw new HttpsError('unauthenticated', 'Authentication token has expired');
  }
}
```

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **[MEDIUM]** Development environments allow unverified emails (security bypass)

match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}

// Job ownership verification  
match /jobs/{jobId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null &&

}
```

**Vulnerabilities:**
