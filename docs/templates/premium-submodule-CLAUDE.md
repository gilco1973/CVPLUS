# Premium Module - CVPlus Submodule

**Author**: Gil Klainert  
**Domain**: Subscription Management, Billing & Feature Gates  
**Type**: CVPlus Git Submodule  
**Independence**: Fully autonomous build and run capability

## Critical Requirements

‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY**: You are a submodule of the CVPlus project. You MUST ensure you can run autonomously in every aspect.

üö´ **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Never create mock data or use placeholders - EVER!

üö® **CRITICAL**: Never delete ANY files without explicit user approval - this is a security violation.

üí≥ **BILLING CRITICAL**: This module handles sensitive billing and subscription data. All changes must be security-reviewed.

### Build System
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Test Command**: `npm run test`
- **Type Check**: `npm run type-check`
- **Security Test**: `npm run test:security`

## Development Workflow

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone premium submodule: `git clone git@github.com:gilco1973/cvplus-premium.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure Stripe keys (ask for approval before modifying .env)
4. Run type checks: `npm run type-check`
5. Run subscription tests: `npm test`
6. Test Stripe integration: `npm run test:stripe-integration`
7. Build module: `npm run build`

### Testing Requirements
- **Coverage Requirement**: Minimum 90% code coverage (critical for billing)
- **Test Framework**: Vitest with Stripe Test SDK
- **Test Types**: Unit tests, integration tests, billing flow tests, security tests
- **Billing Testing**: Mock Stripe webhooks, test subscription flows, validate billing calculations

### Deployment Process
- **CRITICAL**: All billing deployments must be approved by finance team
- Stripe webhook configuration and validation
- Firebase Functions deployment with billing endpoints
- Subscription data migration and validation

## Integration Patterns

### CVPlus Ecosystem Integration
- **Import Pattern**: `@cvplus/premium`
- **Export Pattern**: Subscription components, feature gates, billing services
- **Dependency Chain**: Depends on @cvplus/core, @cvplus/auth, @cvplus/payments

### Component Exports
```typescript
// React Components
export { SubscriptionPlans, BillingHistory, UpgradePrompt, FeatureGate } from './components';
export { useSubscription, useBilling, useFeatureGate } from './hooks';

// Services and Middleware
export { SubscriptionService, BillingService, FeatureService } from './services';
export { premiumGuard, enhancedPremiumGuard, featureGate } from './middleware';

// Types
export * from './types/subscription.types';
export * from './types/billing.types';
export * from './types/premium-features';
```
