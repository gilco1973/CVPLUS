## Rollback Types & Procedures

### Type 1: Full Immediate Rollback

**Purpose:** Restore complete system to pre-deployment state within 5 minutes  
**Use Case:** Critical system failures, security breaches, revenue-blocking issues

#### Execution Steps

**Step 1: Emergency Response Activation (0-30 seconds)**
```bash
# Activate emergency response mode
echo "EMERGENCY ROLLBACK INITIATED: $(date)" >> /var/log/emergency-rollback.log

# Set emergency flag to prevent new deployments
firebase functions:config:set system.emergency_mode=true
```

**Step 2: Immediate Feature Flag Disable (30-60 seconds)**
```bash
# Disable premium gating immediately
firebase functions:config:set external_data.premium_gating_enabled=false
firebase functions:config:set external_data.rollback_mode=true

# Deploy config changes immediately
firebase deploy --only functions:config --force
```

**Step 3: Function Rollback (60-180 seconds)**
```bash
# Restore from backup (pre-prepared backup versions)
cd /backup/functions-pre-premium-gating

# Deploy previous working version
firebase deploy --only functions --force

# Verify deployment
firebase functions:list | grep enrichCVWithExternalData
```

**Step 4: Database State Verification (180-240 seconds)**
```bash
# Verify no corrupted data
firebase firestore:data:get --collection=users --limit=10
firebase firestore:data:get --collection=cv_data --limit=10

# Check for any premium gating artifacts that need cleanup
firebase firestore:data:get --collection=external_data_usage --limit=5
```

**Step 5: System Validation (240-300 seconds)**
```bash
# Test system functionality
curl -X POST https://us-central1-cvplus.cloudfunctions.net/enrichCVWithExternalData \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"cvId": "test", "userId": "test", "sources": ["linkedin"]}'

# Verify response is successful and no premium gating
# Expected: Success without premium validation
```

**Step 6: Monitoring Restoration (300+ seconds)**
```bash
# Check error rates return to normal
firebase functions:log --only enrichCVWithExternalData --limit=50

# Verify user experience restored
# Monitor support channels for confirmation
```

#### Full Rollback Validation Checklist
- [ ] All functions responding normally
- [ ] Error rates below 1%
- [ ] No premium gating blocking any users
- [ ] External data enrichment functioning for all users
- [ ] No data corruption detected
- [ ] User complaints ceased
- [ ] System monitoring shows green status

### Type 2: Gradual Rollback

**Purpose:** Reduce impact while maintaining some premium gating functionality  
**Use Case:** Performance issues, user experience problems, high support volume

#### Phase 1: Reduce Rollout Percentage (10 minutes)
```bash
# Reduce to 50% of current rollout
firebase functions:config:set external_data.rollout_percentage=50
firebase deploy --only functions:config

# Monitor for 30 minutes
# If issues persist, proceed to Phase 2
```

#### Phase 2: Beta Users Only (20 minutes)  
```bash
# Reduce to beta users only (1-5% traffic)
firebase functions:config:set external_data.rollout_percentage=5
firebase functions:config:set external_data.beta_only=true
firebase deploy --only functions:config

# Monitor for 60 minutes
# If issues persist, proceed to Phase 3
```

#### Phase 3: Complete Gradual Rollback (30 minutes)
```bash
# Disable premium gating completely
firebase functions:config:set external_data.premium_gating_enabled=false
firebase deploy --only functions:config

# Plan for fixes and re-deployment
```

### Type 3: Feature-Specific Rollback

**Purpose:** Disable specific problematic features while maintaining others  
**Use Case:** Individual component failures, rate limiting issues, analytics problems

#### Premium Gating Only Rollback
```bash
# Keep new features but disable premium enforcement
firebase functions:config:set external_data.premium_validation=false
firebase functions:config:set external_data.free_access_mode=true
firebase deploy --only functions:config
```

#### Rate Limiting Rollback
```bash
# Disable rate limiting temporarily
firebase functions:config:set external_data.rate_limiting_enabled=false
firebase deploy --only functions:config
```

#### Analytics Rollback
```bash
# Disable usage tracking and analytics
firebase functions:config:set external_data.analytics_enabled=false
firebase functions:config:set external_data.usage_tracking=false
firebase deploy --only functions:config
```

#### System Health Verification
```bash
# Comprehensive system health check
rollback_health_check() {
    echo "=== POST-ROLLBACK HEALTH CHECK ===" 
    echo "Timestamp: $(date)"
    
    # Function availability
    echo "Testing function availability..."
    curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
