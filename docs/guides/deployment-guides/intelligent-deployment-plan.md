- Dependency integrity check
- Firebase project configuration validation
- Current quota usage analysis
- Security rules syntax validation
- Environment variables verification

### Phase 2: Build and Preparation (3-8 minutes)
- Frontend build with optimization
- Functions TypeScript compilation
- Asset bundling and compression
- Size analysis and warnings
- Build artifact validation

### Phase 3: Incremental Deployment (10-30 minutes)
- Database rules deployment (if changed)
- Storage rules deployment (if changed)
- Functions deployment (batched by priority)
- Frontend deployment
- Configuration updates

### Phase 4: Validation and Testing (2-5 minutes)
- Function endpoint health checks
- Frontend accessibility testing
- Database connectivity validation
- End-to-end critical path testing
- Performance baseline verification

### Phase 5: Reporting and Cleanup (1-2 minutes)
- Deployment summary generation
- Performance metrics collection
- Resource utilization analysis
- Cleanup of temporary artifacts

## Error Handling Strategies

### Quota Exceeded Errors
- **Detection**: Monitor quota usage before and during deployment
- **Response**: Implement intelligent batching with delays
- **Recovery**: Queue deployments for off-peak hours
- **Prevention**: Pre-deployment quota analysis and warnings

### Build Failures
- **TypeScript Errors**: Automated type checking and basic fixes
- **Dependency Issues**: Automatic npm cache clearing and reinstall
- **Size Limits**: Bundle analysis and optimization suggestions
- **Recovery**: Fallback to last known good configuration

### Network and Timeout Issues
- **Retry Strategy**: Exponential backoff with jitter
- **Timeout Management**: Adaptive timeouts based on component size
- **Connection Validation**: Pre-deployment network health check
- **Alternative Routes**: Multi-region deployment fallback

### Function-Specific Issues
- **Memory Errors**: Automatic memory allocation optimization
- **Cold Start Issues**: Function warming strategies
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Isolated deployment validation
- **API Limits**: Rate limiting and batching

### Authentication and Permission Issues
- **Token Refresh**: Automatic Firebase token renewal
- **Service Account Fallback**: Alternative authentication methods
- **Permission Validation**: Pre-deployment access verification

## Configuration Management

### Deployment Configuration (`deployment-config.json`)
```json
{
  "retryAttempts": 3,
  "batchSize": 5,
  "timeouts": {
    "build": 600,
    "deployment": 1800,
    "validation": 300
  },
  "quotaThresholds": {
    "functions": 0.8,
    "storage": 0.7,
    "firestore": 0.6
  }
}
```

### Error Recovery Rules (`error-recovery-rules.json`)
- Error pattern matching
- Recovery strategy mapping
- Escalation procedures
- Rollback triggers

### Quota Limits (`quota-limits.json`)
- Project-specific quota definitions
- Usage monitoring thresholds
- Alert configurations

## Success Metrics and Reporting

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Deployment Success Rate**: Target 99.9%
