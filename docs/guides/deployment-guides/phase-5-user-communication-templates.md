#### "Is upgrading to premium worth it for external data features?"

**Template Response:**
```
Hi [USER_NAME],

Great question! Let me help you understand the value of external data features in premium.

📊 **What Premium External Data Gives You:**

**Personalized Insights:**
- Salary data specific to your role, location, and experience
- Industry trends relevant to your career path
- Skills analysis based on your actual profile

**Real-time Intelligence:**
- Current market rates (updated weekly)
- Emerging opportunities in your field
- Trending skills and competencies

**Actionable Intelligence:**
- Specific recommendations for salary negotiations
- Career pivot opportunities
- Skill development priorities

💡 **Real Success Stories:**
- Sarah M. used salary insights to negotiate a 30% raise
- John D. discovered a new career path and increased his earning potential by 45%
- Lisa K. identified key skills that led to her promotion within 6 months

📈 **ROI Perspective:**
Most premium users report that the salary insights alone pay for the subscription many times over. If our data helps you negotiate even a small salary increase, the premium access pays for itself.

🎯 **Perfect for You If:**
- You're planning a career move or job search
- You want to negotiate salary or ask for a promotion
- You're curious about new opportunities in your field
- You want to stay ahead of industry trends

**Try Risk-Free:**
Premium comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. You can explore all features and cancel anytime if it doesn't meet your expectations.

Would you like me to show you a personalized preview of what your external data dashboard would look like, or do you have specific questions about premium benefits?

Best regards,
[SUPPORT_AGENT_NAME]
CVPlus Support Team

#### "The upgrade button isn't working"

**Template Response:**
```
Hi [USER_NAME],

I'm sorry you're experiencing issues with the upgrade process. Let's get this resolved quickly so you can access your premium features!

🔧 **Quick Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) to hard refresh
   - Or try an incognito/private browsing window

2. **Check Payment Method:**
   - Ensure your payment method is up to date
   - Verify there are no blocks on your card for online purchases

3. **Try Different Browser:**
   - Sometimes browser extensions can interfere
   - Chrome, Firefox, or Safari usually work best

4. **Disable Ad Blockers:**
   - Temporarily disable ad blockers during the upgrade process

🚨 **Still Having Issues?**

I'd be happy to process your upgrade manually or troubleshoot further. Could you please tell me:

1. What browser are you using?
2. At what step does the process fail?
3. Do you see any error messages?

I can also schedule a quick screen-share session to walk through it together if that would be helpful.

**Priority Support:**
As you're looking to upgrade to premium, I'll flag this as priority. I'll personally ensure we get this resolved within the next few hours.

You can reply to this email or call our premium support line at [PHONE_NUMBER] for immediate assistance.

Looking forward to welcoming you to our premium community!
