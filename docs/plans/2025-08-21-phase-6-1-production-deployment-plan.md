## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Production Deployment Modes

```bash
# Production deployment with full validation
./scripts/deployment/smart-deploy.sh --production

# Blue-green production deployment
./scripts/deployment/smart-deploy.sh --production --blue-green

# Production rollback
./scripts/deployment/smart-deploy.sh --production --rollback [version]

# Production health check only
./scripts/deployment/smart-deploy.sh --production --health-check-only
```

### 2. Enhanced Configuration Structure

```json
{
  "production": {
    "validation": {
      "requireSecurityScan": true,
      "requirePerformanceBaseline": true,
      "requireComplianceCheck": true,
      "strictModeEnabled": true
    },
    "blueGreen": {
      "enabled": true,
      "healthCheckDuration": 300,
      "trafficSwitchDelay": 60,
      "rollbackThreshold": 0.95
    },
    "monitoring": {
      "alertingEnabled": true,
      "slaMonitoring": true,
      "performanceBaselines": true,
      "businessMetrics": true
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. New Module: Production Manager

**File**: `modules/production-manager.js`
