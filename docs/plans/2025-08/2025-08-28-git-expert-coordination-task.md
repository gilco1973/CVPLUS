# Git Expert Coordination Task - CV Processing Submodule Conversion

**Priority**: CRITICAL - URGENT  
**Coordinator**: Senior Software Architect  
**Assigned Agent**: git-expert  
**Estimated Time**: 2-4 hours  

## Task Overview

The git-expert subagent is required to handle the most critical aspect of the submodule migration: converting `packages/cv-processing/` from a regular directory in the root repository to a proper git submodule while preserving git history.

## Current Situation Analysis

### Critical Issue Identified:
- `packages/cv-processing/` contains extensive CV processing business logic
- It's currently part of the root CVPlus repository (NOT a submodule)
- Git submodule status shows 9 proper submodules, but cv-processing is missing
- Contains active development with uncommitted changes

### Git Status Evidence:
```bash
# Submodule status shows cv-processing is NOT listed:
$ git submodule status
 66562b9d5aa7288fd2fa09a4d12041647f296f19 packages/admin (heads/main)
+65d9fcff435f0d65eacdbbf440a1c52e16bf87e7 packages/analytics (heads/main)
 703767df6fb27aae0197014c191538c13002e001 packages/auth (heads/main)
 # ... other submodules listed, but NO cv-processing
```

## Git Expert Task Requirements

### Primary Objective:
Convert `packages/cv-processing/` to a proper git submodule while preserving:
1. **Complete git history** of all files
2. **Blame information** for debugging and maintenance
3. **All existing functionality** without breaking changes
4. **Current development state** including uncommitted changes

### Specific Technical Requirements:

#### 1. Repository Creation Strategy
- Create new dedicated git repository: `cvplus-cv-processing`
- Establish proper branching structure (main, develop, etc.)
- Configure repository settings and permissions

#### 2. History Preservation Method
The git-expert must choose the optimal approach:

**Option A: git filter-branch approach**
```bash
# Extract cv-processing with full history
git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter packages/cv-processing/ -- --all
```

**Option B: git subtree approach** 
```bash
# Push cv-processing as subtree to new repository
git subtree push --prefix=packages/cv-processing origin cv-processing-branch
```

**Option C: Manual migration with history grafting**
- More complex but potentially safer for large codebases

#### 3. Submodule Integration Steps
1. Remove cv-processing from root repository
2. Add as proper git submodule:
   ```bash
   git submodule add git@github.com:gilco1973/cvplus-cv-processing.git packages/cv-processing
   ```
3. Update `.gitmodules` configuration
4. Verify submodule status and functionality

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

#### HIGH RISKS:
1. **Data Loss Risk**: CV processing contains critical business logic
   - **Mitigation**: Full repository backup before any operations
   - **Rollback Plan**: Maintain backup branch of original structure

2. **History Loss Risk**: Git operations might lose commit history
   - **Mitigation**: Test extraction process on repository copy first
   - **Verification**: Validate full git log preservation after conversion

3. **Active Development Risk**: Uncommitted changes might be lost
   - **Current Status**: cv-processing directory shows modified files in parent repo
   - **Mitigation**: Commit all changes before conversion, or preserve working state

#### MEDIUM RISKS:
1. **Import Path Breaking**: TypeScript imports might break after conversion
   - **Mitigation**: Coordinate with typescript-pro for import updates
   - **Testing**: Full build validation after conversion

2. **Build Process Disruption**: Build configurations might need updates
   - **Mitigation**: Update all build scripts and configurations
   - **Validation**: Test complete build process after conversion

### Pre-Conversion Checklist

The git-expert must verify:
- [ ] Complete backup of current repository state
- [ ] All cv-processing changes are committed or properly staged
- [ ] New repository is created and accessible
- [ ] Test environment is prepared for validation
- [ ] Rollback procedures are documented and ready

### Post-Conversion Validation

The git-expert must confirm:
- [ ] cv-processing appears in `git submodule status`
- [ ] All historical commits are preserved in new repository
- [ ] File blame information is intact
- [ ] Submodule can be updated and committed properly
- [ ] No data loss occurred during conversion

### Coordination Points

#### With Senior Software Architect:
- Report completion status and any issues encountered
- Provide recommendations for subsequent migration phases
- Confirm architecture compliance after conversion

#### With TypeScript Pro:
- Hand off for import path updates once submodule is established
- Coordinate on build configuration updates needed

#### With System Architect:
- Validate that submodule structure meets modular architecture requirements
- Confirm proper separation of concerns achieved

## Expected Deliverables

1. **New Git Repository**: `cvplus-cv-processing` with full history
2. **Updated Root Repository**: cv-processing as proper submodule
3. **Conversion Documentation**: Steps taken and any issues encountered
4. **Validation Report**: Confirmation of successful conversion
5. **Rollback Instructions**: In case reversal is needed

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `git submodule status` shows cv-processing as proper submodule
- [ ] `git log` in cv-processing submodule shows complete history
- [ ] All files preserve their blame information
- [ ] No compilation errors after conversion
- [ ] All existing CV processing functionality works identically

## Timeline Expectations

**Phase 1**: Repository setup and backup (30 minutes)
**Phase 2**: History extraction and new repository creation (1-2 hours)  
**Phase 3**: Submodule integration and testing (30-60 minutes)
**Phase 4**: Validation and documentation (30 minutes)

**Total Estimated Time**: 2.5-4 hours

## Immediate Next Action

**CRITICAL**: This task requires immediate execution as it blocks all subsequent migration phases. The git-expert should begin with a complete repository backup and proceed with the safest history preservation method.

Once cv-processing is successfully converted to a submodule, the remaining migrations can proceed in parallel across different modules with lower risk profiles.
