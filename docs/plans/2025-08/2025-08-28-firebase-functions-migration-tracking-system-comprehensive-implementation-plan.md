```

### Configuration System

The `migration-settings.json` file provides centralized configuration for:

- **Migration Settings:** Batch sizes, concurrency limits, retry policies
- **Risk Thresholds:** Automated approval levels, required tests, review requirements
- **Submodule Configuration:** Repository URLs, deployment strategies, maintainers
- **Testing Configuration:** Timeout settings, test data sources
- **Deployment Settings:** Staging/production configurations, rollout strategies
- **Monitoring:** Health checks, alert thresholds, notification settings
- **Backup and Recovery:** Retention policies, storage configuration
- **Security:** Code scanning, vulnerability checks, access control

## Core Features

### 1. Function Inventory System

**Automated Discovery:**
- Scans `/functions/src/functions/` directory recursively
- Identifies TypeScript function files
- Extracts function metadata (size, dependencies, exports, imports)
- Calculates file hashes for change detection

**Risk Assessment:**
- Analyzes code patterns for risk factors
- Considers function complexity and size
- Evaluates external dependencies
- Classifies functions as low/medium/high/critical risk

**Target Submodule Mapping:**
- Intelligent mapping based on function names and categories
- Explicit configuration overrides
- Dependency-aware placement recommendations

### 2. Migration Status Tracking

**Status Levels:**
- `PENDING` - Not yet migrated
- `ANALYZING` - Under analysis for migration readiness
- `IN_PROGRESS` - Currently being migrated
- `MIGRATED` - Successfully moved to submodule
- `VERIFIED` - Migrated and fully tested
- `FAILED` - Migration attempt failed
- `ROLLBACK` - Rolled back due to issues

**Progress Monitoring:**
- Real-time status updates
- Progress percentage calculations
- Migration timeline tracking
- Bottleneck identification

### 3. Dependency Analysis

**Cross-Function Dependencies:**
- Static code analysis to identify function calls
- Import/export relationship mapping
- Circular dependency detection
- Shared module usage tracking

**Cross-Submodule Dependencies:**
- Identification of functions that depend on other submodules
- Impact analysis for migration order
- Breaking change risk assessment

### 4. Risk Management System

**Risk Scoring Algorithm:**
- Weighted scoring based on multiple factors
- Critical patterns: admin operations, delete functions, billing
- High-risk patterns: batch operations, user deletion, webhooks
- Medium-risk patterns: data creation, file uploads, API calls

**Risk-Based Requirements:**
- Low risk: Basic unit tests, single reviewer
- Medium risk: Integration tests, two reviewers
- High risk: Full test suite, staging validation, three reviewers
- Critical risk: Security tests, canary rollout, rollback plan

### 5. Verification Framework

**Test Types:**
- **Unit Tests:** Function-level testing with mocking
- **Integration Tests:** Service integration validation
- **End-to-End Tests:** Full workflow testing
- **Performance Tests:** Latency and throughput benchmarks
- **Security Tests:** Vulnerability and access control validation

**API Validation:**
- Endpoint discovery and testing
- Response time monitoring
- Error rate tracking
- Authentication validation

### 6. Rollback Capabilities

**Backup System:**
- Pre-migration backup creation
- Source code snapshots
- Deployment state capture
- Database state preservation
- Configuration file backup

**Rollback Strategies:**
- **Git Revert:** Code-level rollback using version control
- **Previous Deployment:** Restore previous Firebase deployment
- **Blue-Green Switch:** Traffic routing to previous environment
- **Function Disable:** Emergency function deactivation
- **Filesystem Restore:** File-level restoration from backup
