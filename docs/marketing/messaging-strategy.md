# CVPlus Marketing Messages & Positioning

## Core Value Proposition

### Why Not Just Use ChatGPT?

#### Option 1: Straightforward Value Contrast
**Why not just use ChatGPT?**
Because ChatGPT is general-purpose. Our AI is built for CVs: ATS scoring, keyword optimization, tailored templates, and unlimited refinements — all in one place.
One-time $49, lifetime access.

#### Option 2: Job-Seeker Focused
**Generic AI ≠ Career AI.**
ChatGPT can rewrite text, but it won't format your CV, score it against ATS, or generate tailored cover letters. That's what we do — and we do it for life, for just $49.

#### Option 3: Hook + Differentiator
**ChatGPT rewrites. We optimize.**
Our AI doesn't just clean up your CV — it makes it job-ready, ATS-friendly, and industry-tailored, with templates and unlimited improvements.
That's the difference.

## Persuasive Upgrade Copy

### Option 1: Friendly & Encouraging
**Start for free, stay forever.**
Our Free Plan gives you enough to polish your CV with basic AI suggestions.
But when it's time to land the job you really want, unlock Lifetime Premium for just $49 — one-time payment, lifetime access.

### Option 2: Bold & Value-Focused
**Your CV deserves more than "good enough."**
The Free Plan lets you test the basics, but the real power is in Lifetime Premium: unlimited improvements, advanced AI features, ATS-proof formatting, and cover letters that get noticed.
All for a one-time $49 fee — no subscriptions.

### Option 3: Trust & Transparency
**Running AI on CVs costs us money every time — which is why we limit free usage.**
Our Lifetime Premium plan removes those limits. For a single $49 payment, you'll get unlimited refinements of your CV, premium templates, ATS optimization, and tailored insights — for life.

## Fair Use Messaging
