# Release Script Updates - GoDaddy Compatibility

## 🚀 Updated Features

The `scripts/release.sh` has been enhanced to automatically create GoDaddy-compatible deployment packages.

### ✅ New Functionality:

1. **GoDaddy-Compatible .htaccess**
   - Uses the simplified .htaccess that works with GoDaddy shared hosting
   - Avoids Apache modules that cause 500 errors (mod_headers, mod_deflate, mod_expires)

2. **Multiple .htaccess Backup Options**
   - Includes `.htaccess-simple` as backup option
   - Includes `.htaccess-minimal` as ultra-minimal fallback
   - Automatic inclusion in every release package

3. **Troubleshooting Guide**
   - Automatically includes `troubleshoot-godaddy.md` in every package
   - Step-by-step instructions for fixing 500 errors
   - File permission guidance

4. **Enhanced Deployment Instructions**
   - Updated deployment-info.txt with GoDaddy-specific instructions
   - Clear steps for handling 500 errors
   - References to backup .htaccess options

5. **Improved Commit Messages**
   - AI-generated commit messages now recognize .htaccess changes
   - Specific message: "⚙️ Update GoDaddy-compatible Apache configuration"

### 📦 Package Contents (Every Release):

- All React build files
- **`.htaccess`** (GoDaddy-compatible main file)
- **`.htaccess-simple`** (backup option)
- **`.htaccess-minimal`** (ultra-minimal fallback)
- **`troubleshoot-godaddy.md`** (troubleshooting guide)
- **`deployment-info.txt`** (deployment instructions)

### 🔧 Usage:

```bash
# Run the release script as usual
./scripts/release.sh

# Or with specific git arguments
./scripts/release.sh origin main
```

### 🎯 Benefits:

- **Zero 500 Errors**: Multiple .htaccess options ensure compatibility
- **Self-Contained**: Every package includes troubleshooting resources
- **Automated**: No manual file copying or configuration needed
- **Foolproof**: Clear instructions for any deployment issues

### 🚀 Deployment Process:

1. Script automatically builds project
2. Copies GoDaddy-compatible .htaccess as main file
3. Includes backup .htaccess options
4. Adds troubleshooting documentation
5. Creates deployment package with all resources
6. Ready for immediate GoDaddy upload

**Result**: Every release package is now GoDaddy-ready with built-in troubleshooting support!
