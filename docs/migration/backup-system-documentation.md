```bash
# Create comprehensive pre-migration backup
./scripts/migration/backup-system.sh full 6 true true

# Parameters:
# - full: Backup type
# - 6: Compression level (1-9)
# - true: Enable encryption
# - true: Enable cleanup of old backups
```

#### Incremental Backup
```bash
# Create incremental backup during migration
./scripts/migration/backup-system.sh incremental 3 true true
```

#### Emergency Backup
```bash
# Create emergency backup with reason
./scripts/migration/backup-system.sh emergency 1 false true "migration-failure"
```

### Verifying Backups

#### Quick Verification
```bash
# Verify latest backup quickly
./scripts/migration/verify-backups.sh quick latest true false
```

#### Full Verification
```bash
# Comprehensive verification of specific backup

```

#### Integrity Check
```bash
# Check backup integrity only
./scripts/migration/verify-backups.sh integrity backup-id-123 true false
```

### Restoring from Backups

#### Test Restore (Recommended First)
```bash
# Test restore capability without making changes
./scripts/migration/restore-system.sh backup-id-123 /tmp/restore-test test false
```

#### Full Restore
```bash
# Complete system restore
./scripts/migration/restore-system.sh backup-id-123 /path/to/restore full false
```

#### Emergency Restore
```bash
# Emergency restoration for critical situations
./scripts/migration/restore-system.sh backup-id-123 /path/to/restore emergency false
```

## Best Practices

### Pre-Migration
1. **Always create full backup before starting migration**
2. **Verify backup integrity immediately after creation**
3. **Test restore procedure in safe environment**
4. **Document backup IDs for reference**

### During Migration
1. **Create incremental backups at major milestones**
2. **Verify critical backups before proceeding**
3. **Monitor backup system health continuously**
4. **Keep backup IDs accessible for emergency use**

### Post-Migration
1. **Maintain backups for retention period**
2. **Regular verification of stored backups**
3. **Clean up expired backups according to policy**
4. **Update backup procedures based on lessons learned**

## Recovery Procedures

### Standard Recovery
1. **Identify appropriate backup using metadata**
2. **Perform backup verification before restore**
3. **Create restore point of current state**
4. **Execute restore with appropriate mode**
5. **Validate restore integrity**
6. **Test critical functionality**

### Emergency Recovery
1. **Identify most recent viable backup**
2. **Execute emergency restore immediately**
3. **Validate critical functions only**
4. **Create post-recovery backup**
5. **Perform comprehensive verification when stable**

### Partial Recovery
1. **Identify specific components to restore**
2. **Use selective restore mode**
3. **Verify component integration**
4. **Test affected functionality**
5. **Document recovery actions**
