## Key Features Implemented

### Role Detection Algorithm
```typescript
confidence = (
  titleMatch * 0.30 +
  skillsMatch * 0.35 +
  experienceMatch * 0.25 +
  industryMatch * 0.08 +
  educationMatch * 0.02
)
```

### Role Profile Structure
Each role profile includes:
- **Matching Criteria**: Keywords for titles, skills, experience, industry, and education
- **Enhancement Templates**: Professional summary, skills structure, experience improvements
- **Validation Rules**: Required sections, critical skills, experience requirements
- **Metadata**: Version, category, active status, creation/update timestamps

### Integration Points
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing `CVTransformationService`
- **Firebase Compatibility**: Uses Firestore for data persistence
- **Claude AI Integration**: Leverages existing `VerifiedClaudeService`
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout

### Performance Features
- **Caching**: In-memory caching of role profiles with configurable TTL
- **Batch Processing**: Support for processing multiple CVs efficiently
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when role detection fails
- **Configuration**: Highly configurable confidence thresholds and weighting factors

## Usage Examples

### Basic Role Detection
```typescript
const roleDetectionService = new RoleDetectionService();
const analysis = await roleDetectionService.detectRoles(parsedCV);
console.log(`Detected: ${analysis.primaryRole.roleName} (${analysis.primaryRole.confidence})`);
```

### Enhanced CV Recommendations
```typescript
const cvTransformationService = new CVTransformationService();
const recommendations = await cvTransformationService.generateRoleEnhancedRecommendations(
  parsedCV,
  true // Enable role detection
);
```

### Profile Management
```typescript
const roleProfileService = new RoleProfileService();
const profiles = await roleProfileService.getAllProfiles();
const engineeringProfiles = await roleProfileService.getProfilesByCategory(RoleCategory.ENGINEERING);
```

## Configuration Options

### Role Detection Configuration
- `confidenceThreshold`: Minimum confidence for valid matches (default: 0.6)
- `maxResults`: Maximum number of role matches to return (default: 5)
- `enableMultiRoleDetection`: Allow multiple role matches (default: true)
- `weightingFactors`: Configurable weights for different matching factors

### Service Configuration
- `enableCaching`: Enable in-memory caching (default: true)
- `cacheTimeout`: Cache TTL in milliseconds (default: 3600000)
- `enableAnalytics`: Enable usage analytics (default: true)

## Integration with Existing CVPlus

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing CV transformation functionality remains unchanged
- New role profile features are opt-in via method parameters
- Existing API endpoints continue to work as before

### Enhanced Functionality
- Standard recommendations now enhanced with role-specific insights
- CV transformation results include role analysis when requested
- Template system provides role-specific enhancement patterns
