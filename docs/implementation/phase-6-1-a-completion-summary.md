- `validateBackupAndRecovery()`: Rollback configuration, deployment history tracking
- `validateMonitoringSetup()`: Alerting configuration, health check availability

**Production-Specific Features**:
- Strict mode enforcement for production deployments
- Required environment variables validation (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.)
- Test coverage threshold enforcement (80% minimum configurable)
- Security vulnerability scanning with npm audit
- Hardcoded secrets detection in source code
- Bundle size optimization recommendations

### 5. Enhanced Intelligent Deploy Orchestrator ✅
**File**: `scripts/deployment/intelligent-deploy.sh`

**Production Mode Integration**:
- Production mode detection and activation
- Enhanced logging for production deployments
- Stricter validation mode activation
- Production-specific environment variable exports
- Blue-green deployment strategy display

### 6. Comprehensive Documentation ✅
**File**: `docs/deployment/production-deployment-guide.md`

**Documentation Coverage**:
- Complete usage guide for all production modes
- Blue-green deployment process flow
- Automated rollback system documentation
- Production monitoring and health check details
- Configuration management guide
- Troubleshooting and best practices
- CI/CD integration examples

## Technical Implementation Details

### Production Deployment Flow
1. **Mode Detection**: Smart deploy detects production flags and sets appropriate environment
2. **Enhanced Validation**: Pre-deployment validator runs production-specific checks
3. **Production Manager**: Orchestrates deployment strategy (standard or blue-green)
4. **Health Validation**: Comprehensive post-deployment health checks
5. **Monitoring Integration**: Continuous monitoring and automated rollback triggers

### Blue-Green Deployment Architecture
- **Slot Management**: Automatic detection and switching between blue/green slots
- **Canary Testing**: 3-minute health check validation on new deployments
- **Traffic Switching**: Gradual traffic migration with 1-minute safety delays
- **Rollback Ready**: Previous slot maintained as standby for instant rollback

### Security Enhancements
- Production environment variable validation
- Security vulnerability scanning integration
- Hardcoded secrets detection
- HTTPS enforcement validation
- CORS configuration verification
- Security headers compliance checking

## Testing Results

### Smart Deploy Interface Testing ✅
- Help message displays correctly with new production options
- Command-line parsing handles all new flags appropriately
- Production mode warning system activates correctly
- Environment detection works as expected

### Production Manager Module Testing ✅
- Module loads and initializes production configuration correctly
- Deployment ID generation and metadata tracking functional
- Production validation coordination works with existing modules
- Health check integration attempts (minor health-checker compatibility issue identified)

### Configuration Loading Testing ✅
- Production configuration loads successfully
- Environment-specific settings apply correctly
- Fallback to defaults when production config missing
- Configuration merging between base and production settings

## Known Issues and Resolutions

### Issue 1: Health Checker Compatibility
**Status**: Identified, Not Critical  
**Description**: Minor compatibility issue with health-checker.js module  
**Impact**: Does not affect core production deployment functionality  
**Resolution**: The existing health-checker.js works independently; integration can be refined in Phase 6.1.B

### Issue 2: Blue-Green Slot Detection
**Status**: Implementation Ready  
**Description**: Blue-green slot detection requires Firebase project configuration  
**Impact**: Blue-green mode will use intelligent fallback to standard production deployment  
**Resolution**: Production environment setup will resolve this naturally
