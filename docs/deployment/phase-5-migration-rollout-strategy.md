## Rollback Procedures

### 1. Immediate Rollback (Critical Issues)

#### Trigger Conditions
- Error rate > 5% for 10 consecutive minutes
- System downtime > 2 minutes
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Data corruption detected

#### Rollback Execution (Target: <5 minutes)
```bash
# Step 1: Immediate feature flag disable
firebase functions:config:set external_data.premium_gating_enabled=false
firebase deploy --only functions:config

# Step 2: Revert to previous function versions
gcloud functions deploy enrichCVWithExternalData --source=backup/previous-version

# Step 3: Verify rollback success
curl -X POST https://us-central1-cvplus.cloudfunctions.net/enrichCVWithExternalData \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": true}'
```

#### Rollback Validation
- [ ] Function endpoints responding normally
- [ ] No premium gating blocking free users
- [ ] Error rates returned to baseline
- [ ] User experience restored to pre-deployment state

### 2. Gradual Rollback (Performance Issues)

#### Trigger Conditions
- Response time increase > 20%
- Conversion rate drop > 50%
- User satisfaction score < 3.0
- Support ticket volume increase > 100%

#### Rollback Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Reduce rollout percentage by 50%
2. **Phase 2**: If issues persist, reduce to 10% (beta only)
3. **Phase 3**: Complete rollback if necessary

#### Rollback Communication
```html
<!-- User notification template -->
<div class="system-notice">
  <h4>External Data Features Temporarily Adjusted</h4>
  <p>We're fine-tuning our external data integration to ensure the best possible experience. Some users may temporarily see the previous version while we optimize performance.</p>
</div>
```

### 3. Partial Rollback (Feature-Specific Issues)

#### Selective Component Rollback
- **Premium Gating Only**: Disable premium enforcement, keep new features
- **Analytics Only**: Disable usage tracking, maintain core functionality  
- **Rate Limiting Only**: Disable rate limits, keep premium gating

#### Configuration Management
```javascript
// Granular feature flag configuration
const ROLLBACK_CONFIG = {
  premiumGating: true,
  usageTracking: false,  // Disabled due to performance issue
  rateLimiting: true,
  securityAudit: true
};
```
