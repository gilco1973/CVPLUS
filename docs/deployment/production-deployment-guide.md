# CVPlus Production Deployment Guide

## Overview

The CVPlus Intelligent Firebase Deployment System now includes comprehensive production deployment capabilities with enhanced validation, blue-green deployments, automated rollback, and production-specific monitoring.

## Production Deployment Modes

### Standard Production Deployment
```bash
# Full production deployment with enhanced validation
./scripts/deployment/smart-deploy.sh --production

# Production deployment with specific environment
./scripts/deployment/smart-deploy.sh --production --environment production
```

### Blue-Green Zero-Downtime Deployment
```bash
# Zero-downtime blue-green deployment
./scripts/deployment/smart-deploy.sh --blue-green

# Blue-green with specific validation settings
./scripts/deployment/smart-deploy.sh --blue-green --force
```

### Production Rollback
```bash
# Rollback to specific version
./scripts/deployment/smart-deploy.sh --rollback v1.2.3

# Emergency rollback to previous version
./scripts/deployment/smart-deploy.sh --rollback latest-stable
```

### Health Check Only
```bash
# Run production health checks without deployment
./scripts/deployment/smart-deploy.sh --health-check-only

# Health checks for specific environment
./scripts/deployment/smart-deploy.sh --health-check-only --environment production
```

## Production Validation Features

### Enhanced Pre-Deployment Validation
- **Security Compliance**: Vulnerability scanning, secrets detection, HTTPS enforcement
- **Performance Baselines**: Bundle size analysis, function optimization checks
- **Test Coverage**: Automated test coverage validation (configurable thresholds)
- **Environment Variables**: Required production environment variable checks
- **Build Configuration**: Production build script validation
- **Dependencies**: Security audit and compatibility checks

### Production-Specific Checks
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, ELEVENLABS_API_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY validation
- Test coverage minimum 80% (configurable)
- Security vulnerability scanning with npm audit
- Hardcoded secrets detection in source code
- Bundle size optimization analysis
- Function count optimization for intelligent batching

## Blue-Green Deployment Process

### Overview
Blue-green deployment ensures zero-downtime production deployments by maintaining two identical production environments (blue and green) and switching traffic between them.

### Process Flow
1. **Current Environment Detection**: Identify which slot (blue/green) is currently serving production traffic
2. **Target Slot Deployment**: Deploy new version to the inactive slot
3. **Canary Testing**: Run health checks on new deployment (configurable duration: 3 minutes)
4. **Traffic Switching**: Gradually switch traffic to new slot (configurable delay: 1 minute)
5. **Validation**: Verify new deployment health and performance
6. **Standby Marking**: Mark previous slot as standby for potential rollback

### Configuration
```json
{
  "production": {
    "blueGreen": {
      "enabled": true,
      "healthCheckDuration": 300,
      "trafficSwitchDelay": 60,
      "rollbackThreshold": 0.95,
      "canaryPercentage": 10,
      "canaryDuration": 180
    }
  }
}
```

## Automated Rollback System

### Rollback Triggers
- Health check failures after deployment
- Error rate threshold exceeded (>5% by default)
- Performance degradation detected
- Security violations detected
- Critical function failures

### Rollback Process
1. **Trigger Detection**: Automated monitoring detects rollback condition
2. **Traffic Switching**: Immediately switch traffic back to previous slot
3. **Validation**: Verify rollback success with health checks
4. **Notification**: Alert stakeholders about rollback event
5. **State Preservation**: Maintain user data integrity during rollback

### Manual Rollback
```bash
# Rollback to specific version
./scripts/deployment/smart-deploy.sh --rollback v1.2.3

# View available rollback versions
ls deployments/
```

## Production Monitoring & Health Checks

### Health Check Categories
1. **Firebase Project Connectivity**: Project access and authentication
2. **Functions Deployment Status**: All 127+ functions availability
3. **Hosting Accessibility**: Frontend availability and response times
4. **Database Connectivity**: Firestore read/write operations
5. **Storage Accessibility**: Firebase Storage file operations
6. **External API Integration**: Anthropic, OpenAI, ElevenLabs connectivity
7. **Performance Benchmarks**: Response times and throughput
8. **Security Validation**: HTTPS enforcement and CORS configuration
9. **Business Logic Validation**: Core CV generation workflows
10. **Error Rate Monitoring**: Application error thresholds

### Performance Baselines
- Function cold start: < 3 seconds

## Troubleshooting Production Deployments

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Production Validation Failures
```bash
# Check specific validation errors
./scripts/deployment/smart-deploy.sh --test --production

# Force deployment despite warnings (use with caution)
./scripts/deployment/smart-deploy.sh --production --force
```

#### 2. Blue-Green Deployment Failures
```bash
# Check deployment logs
tail -f logs/deployment/intelligent-deploy-*.log

# Manual rollback if automatic fails
./scripts/deployment/smart-deploy.sh --rollback previous-version
```

#### 3. Health Check Failures
```bash
# Run isolated health checks
./scripts/deployment/smart-deploy.sh --health-check-only

# Check specific health check module
node scripts/deployment/modules/health-checker.js /path/to/project /path/to/config
```

#### 4. Performance Issues
```bash
# Analyze bundle sizes
npm run analyze

# Check function optimization
node scripts/deployment/modules/quota-manager.js /path/to/project /path/to/config
```
