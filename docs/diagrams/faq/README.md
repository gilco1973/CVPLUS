### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Cyan/Blue gradient (#3B82F6 to #60A5FA)
- **Success**: Green (#10B981)
- **Warning**: Orange/Yellow (#F59E0B)
- **Error**: Red (#EF4444)
- **Neutral**: Gray scale for backgrounds and text

### Visual Hierarchy
- Clean, professional aesthetic
- Modern glassmorphism effects
- Subtle shadows and gradients
- Consistent spacing and typography

### Interactive Elements
- Hover effects with smooth transitions
- Loading states with branded animations
- Feedback mechanisms aligned with brand voice

## Technical Specifications

### Mermaid Diagram Types Used
- **Flowcharts**: User journeys and process flows
- **Graph Diagrams**: Component relationships and architecture
- **Sequence Diagrams**: API interactions and workflows
- **State Diagrams**: Animation states and UI transitions
- **Gantt Charts**: Implementation timelines and dependencies
- **Timeline Diagrams**: Long-term feature planning

### Styling Approach
Each diagram uses consistent CSS classes for semantic color coding:
- `classDef foundation` - Core system elements
- `classDef user` - User-focused components
- `classDef technical` - Technical implementation details
- `classDef optimization` - Performance and enhancement elements

### Accessibility in Diagrams
- High contrast color combinations
- Descriptive node labels and annotations
- Logical flow patterns that work with screen readers
- Alternative text provided in documentation

## Usage Guidelines

### For Development Teams
1. **Reference Architecture Diagrams** before starting implementation
2. **Follow Component Dependencies** shown in roadmap diagrams
3. **Use Testing Workflows** to ensure quality gates are met
