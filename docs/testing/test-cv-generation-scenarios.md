# CV Generation Test Scenarios

## Manual Testing Scenarios to Verify Infinite Loop Fix

### Scenario 1: Basic CV Generation
**Purpose:** Verify basic CV generation works without infinite loops

**Steps:**
1. Upload a CV file
2. Select a template (e.g., "modern")
3. Select NO additional features
4. Click "Generate CV"
5. Wait for completion

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Job status progresses: `generating` → `completed`
- ✅ Generated CV appears within 1-2 minutes
- ✅ No "No Generated CV Found" message
- ✅ Download buttons are available

### Scenario 2: CV Generation with Features
**Purpose:** Verify feature processing doesn't cause infinite loops

**Steps:**
1. Upload a CV file
2. Select a template
3. Select 3-5 features (e.g., Skills Visualization, ATS Optimization, Language Proficiency)
4. Click "Generate CV"
5. Monitor feature progress

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Job status: `generating` → `completed`
- ✅ Features show progression: `pending` → `processing` → `completed`
- ✅ Generated CV appears with enhanced features
- ✅ Feature processing completes within 5-10 minutes
- ✅ Some features may fail but CV still generates

### Scenario 3: Feature Skip Functionality
**Purpose:** Verify skip feature prevents stuck states

**Steps:**
1. Upload a CV file
2. Select multiple features including complex ones (e.g., Podcast Generation, Video Introduction)
3. Click "Generate CV"
4. When features are processing, click "Skip" on a slow feature
5. Wait for completion

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Skipped feature status changes to `skipped`
- ✅ Other features continue processing
- ✅ CV generation completes successfully
- ✅ No infinite loops from skipped features

### Scenario 4: Error Recovery
**Purpose:** Verify error handling doesn't cause infinite loops

**Steps:**
1. Upload a problematic CV file (if available)
2. Select features that might fail
3. Click "Generate CV"
4. Wait for completion or errors

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Job status eventually reaches `completed` or `failed`
- ✅ Failed features are marked as `failed`
- ✅ Error messages are clear and helpful
- ✅ No infinite "generating" state

### Scenario 5: Network Interruption Recovery
**Purpose:** Verify system handles network issues gracefully

**Steps:**
1. Start CV generation
2. Temporarily disconnect internet during processing
3. Reconnect after 30 seconds
4. Observe system behavior

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ System continues processing when reconnected
- ✅ Job status updates resume
- ✅ No duplicate processing
- ✅ Final completion is achieved

## Automated Test Commands

### 1. Run System Verification
```bash
cd /Users/gklainert/Documents/cvplus
node scripts/verify-cv-generation-fix-simple.js
```

### 2. Check Function Deployment
```bash
firebase functions:list | grep -E "(initiateCVGeneration|generateCV)"
```

### 3. Test Function Build
```bash
npm run build
echo "Build Status: $?"
```

### 4. Monitor Function Logs (During Testing)
```bash
firebase functions:log --only initiateCVGeneration,generateCV
```

## Success Criteria

### ✅ Fix is Confirmed Working When:
1. **No Infinite Loops:** CV generation always reaches a final state (`completed` or `failed`)
2. **No "No Generated CV Found":** Users always see either a generated CV or a clear error message
3. **Predictable Timing:** Basic CV generation completes within 1-2 minutes
4. **Feature Resilience:** Individual feature failures don't break the entire process
5. **User Control:** Skip functionality allows users to bypass problematic features
6. **Clear Status:** Job status always progresses logically through defined states

### ❌ Fix Needs Attention When:
1. Jobs stuck in `generating` state for >10 minutes
2. "No Generated CV Found" message appears despite successful feature completion
3. CV generation never completes (infinite loop symptoms)
4. Skip feature doesn't work or causes errors
5. Status updates stop occurring
6. Users cannot access their generated CV after completion

## Monitoring in Production

### Key Metrics to Track:
1. **Generation Success Rate:** Should be >95%
2. **Average Generation Time:** Should be <3 minutes for basic CV
3. **Feature Success Rate:** Should be >80% per feature
4. **Skip Feature Usage:** Monitor frequency of skips
5. **Error Patterns:** Track common failure reasons

### Alert Conditions:
- Generation success rate drops below 90%
- Average generation time exceeds 5 minutes
- More than 5 jobs stuck in `generating` state
- Increase in "No Generated CV Found" reports
