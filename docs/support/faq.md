# CVPlus Frequently Asked Questions

## Account & Usage

### ❓ Can I use my account to improve a friend's CV?
**No.** Each account is licensed for personal use only. Uploading CVs that belong to someone else is against our Fair Use Policy. If you're a recruiter or coach, please explore our Professional Plan.

### ❓ What does "3 unique CVs per month" mean?
This means you can work on up to 3 completely different CV versions per month. For example:
- One tailored for marketing roles
- One for project management 
- One for tech roles

Within each, you can make **unlimited refinements**.

### ❓ Can I edit the PDF or HTML after I download it?
**Yes, technically you can edit exported files** — but they are licensed for your personal use only. Editing them to represent another person violates our policy and may result in account suspension.

### ❓ What if I need more than 3 unique CVs per month?
Most job seekers won't need more than 3 different versions. If you do, you may request an upgrade or check our upcoming Professional Plan for high-volume needs.

## Free Plan Questions

### ❓ Why are free exports limited?
Because parsing and exporting CVs costs us money every time. To keep the Free Plan available for everyone, we limit exports and reserve full PDF/HTML downloads for Premium users.

### ❓ Can I upgrade from Free to Premium anytime?
**Yes!** Your Free Plan usage history is preserved, and you immediately gain access to all Premium features with a one-time $49 payment.

### ❓ Will the Free Plan always be free?
**Yes.** We're committed to keeping basic CV improvement tools accessible to everyone. The Free Plan will always remain free.

## Premium Plan Questions

### ❓ Is there really no subscription fee?
**Correct!** Pay once ($49), access forever. No hidden fees, no recurring charges, no subscription traps.

### ❓ What happens if CVPlus shuts down?

- Refund consideration for recent purchases

### ❓ Can I get a refund?
