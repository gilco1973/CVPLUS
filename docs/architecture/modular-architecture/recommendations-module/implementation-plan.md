## Technical Implementation Details

### AI Integration Implementation
```typescript
// Core AI service implementation highlights
class AIIntegrationService {
  async generateRecommendations(cvData: CVData, context: AnalysisContext): Promise<Recommendation[]> {
    // 1. Build optimized prompt
    const prompt = await this.promptEngine.buildPrompt(cvData, context);
    
    // 2. Check cache first
    const cacheKey = this.cache.generateKey(cvData, context);
    const cached = await this.cache.get(cacheKey);
    if (cached) return cached;
    
    // 3. Call Claude API with retry logic
    const response = await this.retryService.withRetry(
      () => this.claudeClient.messages.create({
        model: 'claude-3-sonnet-20240229',
        max_tokens: 2000,
        messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }]
      }),
      { maxAttempts: 3, baseDelay: 1000 }
    );
    
    // 4. Parse and validate response
    const recommendations = await this.parseRecommendations(response.content[0].text);
    
    // 5. Cache for future use
    await this.cache.set(cacheKey, recommendations, { ttl: 1800 }); // 30 minutes
    
    return recommendations;
  }
}
```

### Caching Implementation
```typescript
// Multi-level caching implementation
class CacheService {
  async get(key: string): Promise<Recommendation[] | null> {
    // L1: Memory cache (fastest)
    const memoryResult = this.memoryCache.get(key);
    if (memoryResult) return memoryResult;
    
    // L2: Redis cache (fast)
    const redisResult = await this.redisClient.get(key);
    if (redisResult) {
      const data = JSON.parse(redisResult);
      this.memoryCache.set(key, data); // Populate L1
      return data;
    }
    
    return null;
  }
  
  async set(key: string, data: Recommendation[], options?: CacheOptions): Promise<void> {
    // Store in both levels
    this.memoryCache.set(key, data);
    await this.redisClient.setex(key, options?.ttl || 1800, JSON.stringify(data));
  }
}
```

### React Hook Implementation
```typescript
// React hook for recommendations
export function useRecommendations(cvId: string) {
  const [recommendations, setRecommendations] = useState<Recommendation[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<Error | null>(null);
  
  const fetchRecommendations = useCallback(async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    setError(null);
    
    try {
      const service = new RecommendationsService();
      const result = await service.getRecommendations(cvId);
      setRecommendations(result);
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err instanceof Error ? err : new Error('Unknown error'));
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  }, [cvId]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (cvId) {
      fetchRecommendations();
    }
  }, [cvId, fetchRecommendations]);
  
  return {
    recommendations,
    loading,
