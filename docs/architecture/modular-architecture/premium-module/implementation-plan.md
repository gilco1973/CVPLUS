    // Atomic increment in Redis
    const newUsage = await this.redis.incrby(key, amount);
    
    // Check limits
    const subscription = await this.subscriptionService.getActiveSubscription(userId);
    const plan = await this.subscriptionService.getPlan(subscription.planId);
    const limit = plan.limits[feature];
    
    if (newUsage > limit) {
      // Rollback and deny
      await this.redis.decrby(key, amount);
      return { success: false, reason: 'LIMIT_EXCEEDED' };
    }
    
    // Update persistent storage asynchronously
