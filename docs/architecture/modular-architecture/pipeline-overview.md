# CVPlus CI/CD Pipeline Overview

## Pipeline Architecture

The CVPlus project uses a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline built with GitHub Actions, designed to support a modular monorepo architecture.

### Workflows

#### Module CI/CD Pipelines
- **ci-core.yml**: Core module testing, building, and validation
- **ci-auth.yml**: Authentication module with Firebase integration tests
- **ci-recommendations.yml**: AI recommendations module with mock API testing
- **ci-integration.yml**: Cross-module compatibility and integration testing

#### Deployment Pipelines  
- **deploy-functions.yml**: Firebase Functions deployment with firebase-deployment-specialist
- **deploy-frontend.yml**: Frontend deployment to Firebase Hosting

#### Quality Assurance
- **quality-gates.yml**: Code quality, linting, and coverage enforcement
- **performance-monitoring.yml**: Build performance and bundle size monitoring
- **security-scanning.yml**: Comprehensive security analysis (SAST, secrets, dependencies)

### Quality Standards

#### Test Coverage
- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% for all packages
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-module compatibility validation
- **End-to-End Tests**: Critical user workflows

#### Security Standards
- **Zero High/Critical Vulnerabilities**: Blocks deployment
- **Secret Scanning**: Prevents credential exposure
- **SAST Analysis**: Static security analysis
- **Dependency Auditing**: Regular vulnerability scanning

#### Performance Benchmarks
- **Build Time**: < 5 minutes for full monorepo
- **Test Execution**: < 3 minutes for all test suites
- **Bundle Sizes**: 
  - Core: < 50KB
  - Auth: < 100KB
  - Recommendations: < 200KB
  - Frontend: < 5MB

### Deployment Strategy

#### Environment Promotion
1. **Development**: Feature branch deployments
2. **Staging**: Main branch integration testing
3. **Production**: Tagged releases with manual approval

#### Rollback Capabilities
- **Firebase Functions**: Automated rollback on failure
- **Frontend Hosting**: Version history with instant rollback
- **Package Versions**: Semantic versioning with dependency management

### Monitoring and Alerting

#### Success Metrics
- **Build Success Rate**: 95%+ target
- **Deployment Success**: 99%+ target
- **Security Scan Pass**: 100% requirement

#### Alert Configuration
- **Slack Integration**: Immediate notifications for failures
- **Email Alerts**: Critical security issues
- **Dashboard Updates**: Performance trend monitoring

## Usage

### Manual Triggers
All workflows support manual triggering with configurable options:

```bash
# Trigger specific deployment
gh workflow run deploy-functions.yml -f deployment_mode=full -f environment=production

# Run security scan
gh workflow run security-scanning.yml -f scan_type=full

# Monitor performance
gh workflow run performance-monitoring.yml -f monitoring_scope=full
```

### Branch Protection
Recommended branch protection rules:
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks (quality gates)
- Restrict pushes to main branch
- Require branches to be up to date

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor performance trends
- Review security scan results
- Update dependency versions
- Optimize build performance

### Quarterly Reviews
- Evaluate pipeline efficiency
- Update security policies
- Review quality thresholds
- Plan infrastructure improvements
