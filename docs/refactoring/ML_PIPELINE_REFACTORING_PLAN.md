# ML Pipeline Service Refactoring Plan

## Current State Analysis

The `ml-pipeline.service.ts` file (1205 lines) is a critical service that handles:
- Success prediction orchestration
- Feature engineering for ML models
- ML model training and management
- External ML service integration
- Recommendation generation
- Outcome tracking and learning
- Caching and performance optimization
- Fallback mechanisms

## Modular Architecture Design

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. Create base directory structure
2. Extract caching logic to `PredictionCache.ts`
3. Extract external ML service integration to `ExternalMLService.ts`
4. Create main orchestrator foundation

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering (Week 2)
1. Extract feature extraction services
2. Implement feature caching
3. Test feature extraction independently

### Phase 3: Prediction Services (Week 3)
1. Extract individual prediction services
2. Implement fallback mechanisms
3. Test prediction accuracy

### Phase 4: Model Management (Week 4)
1. Extract model lifecycle management
2. Implement monitoring and health checks
3. Extract training pipeline

### Phase 5: Recommendations & Outcomes (Week 5)
1. Extract recommendation engine
2. Extract outcome tracking
3. Implement learning mechanisms

### Phase 6: Integration & Testing (Week 6)
1. Integrate all services through main orchestrator
2. Comprehensive testing
3. Performance validation
4. Gradual deployment with feature flags

## Benefits Expected

1. **Maintainability**: Each service < 200 lines, single responsibility
2. **Testability**: Independent unit testing of each component
3. **Scalability**: Individual services can be optimized/scaled separately
4. **Reliability**: Isolated failures, better error handling
5. **Team Productivity**: Multiple developers can work on different services
6. **Performance**: Better caching, lazy loading, parallel processing

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Gradual Migration**: Strangler fig pattern with feature flags
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Each service tested independently and integrated
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Original API contract maintained
4. **Rollback Plan**: Easy rollback to monolithic service if needed
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance tracking during migration
