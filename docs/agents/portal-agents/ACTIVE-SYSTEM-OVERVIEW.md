# 🎭 Active Agent Orchestration System

## Overview

The Claude Code agent framework has been transformed from static documentation into a **fully functional, self-improving orchestration system** that automatically coordinates multi-agent workflows, applies adaptive personalities, and learns from outcomes.

## 🚀 What's Now Active

### 🎭 **Choreography Engine** - ✅ LIVE
**Location**: `.claude/agents/orchestration/choreography-engine.md`

**Function**: Automatically detects when to trigger collaboration patterns
- **Pattern Recognition**: Analyzes user input for feature, bug, or review keywords
- **Auto-Activation**: Suggests or starts appropriate multi-agent workflows
- **Manual Override**: Allows explicit choreography control

**Example**:
```
User: "implement user authentication system"
System: 🎭 Feature Development Dance detected! Coordinating 7-agent implementation...
```

### 🧠 **Personality Engine** - ✅ LIVE  
**Location**: `.claude/agents/orchestration/personality-engine.md`

**Function**: Applies adaptive personalities to all agent responses
- **Dynamic Loading**: Reads personality files (`.claude/agents/personalities/*.yaml`)
- **Response Transformation**: Modifies communication style, detail level, directness
- **Context Adaptation**: Adjusts based on project urgency and team experience
- **Evolution Learning**: Personalities improve based on success patterns

**Example**:
```
@software-engineering-expert (Detail: 90%, Conservative: 70%):
"I'll implement a comprehensive OAuth 2.0 authentication system with PKCE flow, 
JWT access tokens (15-minute expiry), refresh token rotation (7-day expiry), 
and Redis-backed session management. This architecture ensures enterprise-grade 
security while maintaining scalability..."
```
