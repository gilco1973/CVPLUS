# üöÄ Unified Agent System - Key Highlights

## ü§ñ 68 Specialized AI Agents + Advanced Orchestration

**Intelligent Agent Coordination:**
- **Master Orchestrator** with multi-dimensional analysis and smart agent selection
- **Strategic Technical Leadership** for enterprise architecture decisions
- **Project Intelligence** with PRD parsing and AI-powered task generation
- **Auto Team Configuration** that detects your tech stack and optimizes agent teams

## üß† Live MCP Server Integrations

**Real-Time External Capabilities:**
- **GitHub MCP**: Live repository operations, PR management, workflow automation via GitHub API
- **Task Master MCP**: Project task management, complexity analysis, dependency tracking, PRD parsing
- **Context7 MCP**: Up-to-date library documentation, API references, current code examples
- **Basic Memory MCP**: Persistent organizational knowledge, pattern storage, cross-project learning

## üìã Comprehensive Coding Rules & Best Practices

**Automatic Quality Enforcement:**
- **Universal Rules**: SEC001-003 (security), PERF001-005 (performance)
- **Language-Specific**: Python (S1244, S1481, S5445), TypeScript (S1481, S2589, S3776, S4138), Go (S1005, S1006, S1021, S1030), JavaScript (S1481)
- **Natural Language Management**: "Add rule python:S1500", "Update rule SEC001", "List security rules"
- **Auto-Application**: All development agents automatically check and apply relevant rules during code generation

## üõ°Ô∏è Automated Quality System (Trunk.io Integration)

**Zero-Configuration Quality Pipeline:**
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically initializes Trunk.io for repositories without quality systems
- **Multi-Language**: Python (black, flake8, mypy), TypeScript/JS (eslint, prettier), Go (gofmt, golangci-lint)
- **Pre-Commit Gates**: Automatic formatting, issue fixing, quality validation before every commit
- **Universal Security**: OSV scanner, Gitleaks for vulnerability detection across all languages

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Excellence Framework

**Built-in Best Practices:**
- **Evil Corp Standards**: Maintainable, readable, extensible code quality requirements
- **Fault Tolerance**: Circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, graceful degradation patterns
- **Structured Logging**: JSON logging, contextual information, observability integration
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic recovery patterns and comprehensive health monitoring

## ü§ù Intelligent Collaboration Patterns

**Advanced Agent Coordination:**
- **Proactive Agents**: Auto-activate based on context (orchestrator, code reviewer, quality system)
- **Manual/On-Demand**: Specialized workflows like PR reviews with interactive approval gates
- **Cross-Domain Expertise**: Multiple agents collaborate on complex interdisciplinary problems
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Agents share context and maintain consistency across implementations

## üöÄ Quick Start Experience

**Get Running in Minutes:**
```bash
# 1. Auto-analyze your project
claude "Use @team-configurator to analyze my project structure"

# 2. Generate personalized CLAUDE.md with commit requirements
claude "Create a CLAUDE.md file for my project based on analysis"

# 3. Start building with automatic quality
claude "Use @rails-expert to build authentication with circuit breakers"
# ‚Üí Auto-applies coding rules, quality checks, and commits with agent attribution
```

## üí° Real-World Usage Examples

**Backend Development:**
```bash
"Use @django-backend-expert to create user management API"
# ‚Üí Applies python:S1244, SEC001, PERF001, auto-formats, commits as:
# "feat(auth): implement user management API - @django-backend-expert @security-auditor"
```

**Project Management:**
```bash
"Use @project-analyst to parse this PRD and generate tasks"
# ‚Üí AI-powered task generation with dependencies via Task Master MCP
```

**Code Quality:**
```bash
"Use @pr-reviewer-specialist to review PR #123"
# ‚Üí Interactive GitHub PR review with security/performance analysis
```

**Organizational Memory:**
```bash
"Use @rails-expert to find authentication patterns from previous projects"
# ‚Üí Searches Basic Memory MCP for reusable patterns and implementations
```

## üéØ What Makes This Different

‚úÖ **Live External Integrations** - Real GitHub API operations, not just static analysis  
‚úÖ **Persistent Organizational Knowledge** - Learn and reuse patterns across projects
