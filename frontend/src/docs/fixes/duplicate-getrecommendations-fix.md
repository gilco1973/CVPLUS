# Fix: Duplicate getRecommendations Calls

## Problem
The `getRecommendations` function was being called twice, causing inefficient API usage and potential race conditions.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **React StrictMode**: The application runs in React StrictMode during development, which intentionally double-executes effects to help detect side effects.
2. **useEffect Dependencies**: The useEffect hook was triggering on every change without proper guards.
3. **Component Re-rendering**: Potential component re-mounting could cause additional calls.

## Solution Implemented
Fixed the duplicate calls by implementing the following in `CVAnalysisResults.tsx`:

### 1. State-Based Guards
- Added `recommendationsLoaded` state to track if recommendations have been loaded
- Added `currentJobId` state to ensure we don't reload for the same job
- Added checks to prevent calls while already loading

### 2. Component Lifecycle Management
- Added `isMountedRef` to prevent state updates on unmounted components
- Added cleanup function to handle component unmounting
- Added mounted checks before all state updates

### 3. Improved Logging
- Added detailed console logs to track function calls and state changes
- Added job ID tracking in all log messages for better debugging

### 4. useCallback Optimization
- Wrapped the async function in useCallback to optimize dependencies
- Properly managed dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-runs

## Code Changes
```typescript
// Added state management
const [recommendationsLoaded, setRecommendationsLoaded] = useState(false);
const [currentJobId, setCurrentJobId] = useState<string | null>(null);
const isMountedRef = useRef(true);

// Added guards in useEffect
if (recommendationsLoaded && currentJobId === job.id) {
  return; // Skip if already loaded for this job
}

if (isLoadingRecommendations) {
  return; // Skip if already loading
}

// Added mounted checks before state updates
if (!isMountedRef.current) return;
```

## Testing
1. The fix prevents duplicate calls in React StrictMode
2. Console logs show proper execution flow
3. TypeScript compilation passes without errors
4. Loading states work correctly

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/CVAnalysisResults.tsx`

## Impact
- Eliminates duplicate API calls
- Improves performance and reduces backend load
- Prevents potential race conditions
- Maintains proper loading states
- Compatible with React StrictMode

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing a global request cache/deduplication system
- Monitor API call patterns in production
- Consider using React Query or SWR for better caching and deduplication
