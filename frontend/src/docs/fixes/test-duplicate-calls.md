# Testing the Duplicate getRecommendations Fix

## How to Test the Fix

### 1. Development Environment Test
1. Start the Firebase emulators: `firebase emulators:start --only functions,firestore,auth,storage`
2. Start the frontend dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open browser developer tools (F12) and go to Console tab
4. Navigate to a CV analysis results page: `http://localhost:3003/analysis/{jobId}`

### 2. What to Look For

#### Before the Fix (Would See):
```
[CVAnalysisResults] useEffect triggered for job abc123...
[CVAnalysisResults] Starting loadAnalysisAndRecommendations for job abc123
[CVAnalysisResults] Calling getRecommendations for job: abc123
[CVAnalysisResults] getRecommendations completed for job: abc123
[CVAnalysisResults] useEffect triggered for job abc123... (DUPLICATE)
[CVAnalysisResults] Starting loadAnalysisAndRecommendations for job abc123 (DUPLICATE)
[CVAnalysisResults] Calling getRecommendations for job: abc123 (DUPLICATE)
```

#### After the Fix (Should See):
```
[CVAnalysisResults] useEffect triggered for job abc123...
[CVAnalysisResults] Starting loadAnalysisAndRecommendations for job abc123
[CVAnalysisResults] Calling getRecommendations for job: abc123
[CVAnalysisResults] getRecommendations completed for job: abc123
[CVAnalysisResults] useEffect triggered for job abc123...
[CVAnalysisResults] Skipping - recommendations already loaded for job abc123
```

### 3. StrictMode Test
The fix should work correctly even with React StrictMode enabled (which is the default in development).

### 4. Component Re-mount Test
1. Navigate away from the analysis page
2. Navigate back to the same analysis page
3. Should see only one call to getRecommendations

### 5. Loading State Test
1. While recommendations are loading, the component should show proper loading indicators
2. No duplicate calls should occur during loading

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Only one call to `getRecommendations` per job per component mount
- ✅ Proper loading states displayed
- ✅ No memory leaks on component unmount
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging
- ✅ Works correctly in React StrictMode

## Additional Monitoring
Monitor the Firebase Functions logs to confirm only one request is made:
```bash
firebase functions:log --only getRecommendations
```

This should show only one request per job analysis, not duplicates.
