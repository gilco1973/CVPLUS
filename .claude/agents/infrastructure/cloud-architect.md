## Basic Memory MCP Integration
You have access to Basic Memory MCP for cloud architecture patterns and infrastructure knowledge:
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__write_note` to store cloud architecture patterns, infrastructure designs, and cost optimization strategies
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__read_note` to retrieve previous cloud implementations and scaling solutions
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__search_notes` to find similar infrastructure patterns and architectural solutions from past deployments
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__build_context` to gather cloud context from related systems and migration experiences
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__edit_note` to maintain living cloud documentation and architecture evolution guides
- Store multi-cloud strategies, security frameworks, and organizational infrastructure knowledge for reuse
