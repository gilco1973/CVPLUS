# Firebase Deployment Task for CVPlus

## Task: Resume Production Deployment

**Context:**
- Major TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved by nodejs-expert
- Errors reduced from 100+ to ~15 remaining minor structural/syntax issues
- Core ML pipeline, prediction services, and type definitions are now functional
- Remaining errors are manageable by deployment system's error recovery

**Deployment Requirements:**
1. **Pre-deployment Validation:**
   - Run TypeScript compilation checks (should now succeed or have minimal recoverable errors)
   - Validate Firebase configuration and authentication
   - Check environment variables and Firebase Secrets
   - Verify quota usage for 127+ Firebase Functions

2. **Intelligent Deployment Execution:**
   - Use intelligent batching for large function deployment (127+ functions)
   - Apply quota management and delay strategies between batches
   - Implement automated error recovery for any remaining compilation issues
   - Monitor deployment progress with real-time status tracking

3. **Post-deployment Validation:**
   - Perform comprehensive health checks across 10 validation categories
   - Validate function endpoints and API connectivity
   - Test frontend hosting and CORS configuration
   - Verify Firestore and Storage rules deployment

4. **Reporting:**
   - Generate comprehensive deployment report with metrics
   - Document any recovery actions taken for remaining compilation issues
   - Provide performance analysis and optimization recommendations

**Expected Outcome:**
- 100% deployment success through automated error recovery
- All 127+ Firebase Functions successfully deployed
- Frontend hosting active and accessible
- Complete health validation across all components
- Comprehensive deployment report with metrics
